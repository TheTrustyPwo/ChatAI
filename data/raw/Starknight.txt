8/28/20, 15:10 - Ethan: What
8/28/20, 15:10 - bad: yay
8/28/20, 15:10 - Ethan: U want more paradoxes
8/28/20, 15:10 - bad: i at home now
8/28/20, 15:10 - Ethan: Noo
8/28/20, 15:10 - bad: and my fone is alive
8/28/20, 15:10 - bad: ha
8/28/20, 15:10 - bad: 3%
8/28/20, 15:10 - Ethan: Is it tho r did I just delay the time it will die
8/28/20, 15:11 - Ethan: If a crocodile steals a mothers son and the crocodile will only return it if she guesses whether he will return it
8/28/20, 15:11 - Ethan: Les say he decides not to
8/28/20, 15:11 - Ethan: If she says he wont
8/28/20, 15:11 - Ethan: Then will he
8/28/20, 15:11 - bad: no
8/28/20, 15:11 - Ethan: But he will contradict his words
8/28/20, 15:11 - bad: y
8/28/20, 15:11 - bad: er
8/28/20, 15:11 - bad: i see
8/28/20, 15:11 - Ethan: .
8/28/20, 15:12 - Ethan: Paradox
8/28/20, 15:12 - bad: but crocodile no talk
8/28/20, 15:12 - bad: ha
8/28/20, 15:12 - bad: no more paradox
8/28/20, 15:12 - bad: aha
8/28/20, 15:12 - Ethan: Simply walking a distance u have to create an infinite amount of tasks
8/28/20, 15:12 - bad: wat
8/28/20, 15:12 - Ethan: Cuz to walk that distance u have to walk half of it
8/28/20, 15:12 - Ethan: N so on n so forth
8/28/20, 15:13 - Ethan: Which isnt act possible
8/28/20, 15:13 - bad: erm
8/28/20, 15:13 - bad: me no understand
8/28/20, 15:15 - Ethan: To walk the distance u have to walk half of the distance and to walk half of the distance u have to walk a quarter
8/28/20, 15:15 - Ethan: N this goes on infinitely
8/28/20, 15:15 - bad: well yes
8/28/20, 15:15 - Ethan: So
8/28/20, 15:15 - bad: until it be so smol u dont need walk
8/28/20, 15:15 - Ethan: It cant be
8/28/20, 15:15 - Ethan: Every number can be divided by two
8/28/20, 15:16 - bad: yes
8/28/20, 15:16 - Ethan: So it will never become zeto
8/28/20, 15:16 - bad: but once its smaller than a electron
8/28/20, 15:16 - Ethan: Its still a distance
8/28/20, 15:16 - bad: erm no
8/28/20, 15:16 - bad: u would be past ur destination
8/28/20, 15:16 - Ethan: Walking that very width is a task
8/28/20, 15:16 - bad: if u walk
8/28/20, 15:16 - Ethan: What
8/28/20, 15:17 - bad: u cant walk a distance smoler than a electron
8/28/20, 15:17 - Ethan: Yes u walk pass
8/28/20, 15:17 - Ethan: So that's a taso
8/28/20, 15:17 - bad: ya la
8/28/20, 15:17 - bad: so no more paradox
8/28/20, 15:17 - Ethan: I said task not destination
8/28/20, 15:17 - bad: well reaching destination is a task
8/28/20, 15:17 - bad: anyways
8/28/20, 15:17 - bad: u be done with ur tasks
8/28/20, 15:17 - Ethan: A task it not reaching a destination
8/28/20, 15:17 - bad: :)
8/28/20, 15:18 - Ethan: Yes
8/28/20, 15:18 - bad: ya
8/28/20, 15:18 - bad: so no paradox
8/28/20, 15:18 - bad: i so smart
8/28/20, 15:24 - Ethan: What

9/2/20, 20:02 - Ethan: I got 25643 for q8
9/2/20, 20:02 - Ethan: I tot 25643 rounded to nearest number is 25643
9/2/20, 20:03 - bad: wat
9/2/20, 20:03 - bad: paper d
9/2/20, 20:03 - bad: or wat

9/2/20, 20:05 - bad: wat
9/2/20, 20:05 - bad: its 8%/100
9/2/20, 20:05 - Ethan: What its half yearly
9/2/20, 20:05 - Ethan: So have to 8 divided by two
9/2/20, 20:06 - bad: its 8% per annum
9/2/20, 20:06 - Ethan: Did u get the ans
9/2/20, 20:06 - Ethan: Ya
9/2/20, 20:06 - Ethan: Its compounded half yearly
9/2/20, 20:06 - bad: y isit 100
9/2/20, 20:06 - Ethan: So in formula u can either write 8/100 then to the power of 2 or 4/100 to the power of 4
9/2/20, 20:07 - Ethan: Cuz 8/100 divided by 2 is 4/100
9/2/20, 20:07 - Ethan: I think it's the same
9/2/20, 20:07 - bad: er
9/2/20, 20:07 - bad: it shld be 8%/2
9/2/20, 20:07 - bad: to power or 4
9/2/20, 20:07 - Ethan: What
9/2/20, 20:07 - Ethan: No
9/2/20, 20:07 - bad: erm

9/2/20, 20:08 - Ethan: What
9/2/20, 20:08 - Ethan: I'm literally 1 away from the ans
9/2/20, 20:08 - Ethan: So I think our methods both can
9/2/20, 20:08 - bad: interest/no of times compounded during time period
9/2/20, 20:08 - Ethan: Show
9/2/20, 20:08 - Ethan: I see
9/2/20, 20:08 - bad: show wat

2/27/21, 10:24 - Ethan: It doesn't make it not mean
2/27/21, 10:25 - Ethan: Just because an animal has to kill u for food

2/27/21, 10:44 - Ethan: U would do it cuz u can
2/27/21, 10:45 - bad: and if i wanted to

2/27/21, 10:45 - Ethan: Not literally fitter
2/27/21, 10:45 - Ethan: But perhaps more wealth

2/27/21, 10:46 - Ethan: Ur more powerful
2/27/21, 10:47 - Ethan: Killing oneself doesnt apply here
2/27/21, 10:47 - Ethan: If ur suicidal
2/27/21, 10:47 - Ethan: Ur still powerful
2/27/21, 10:47 - bad: survival of the fittest still
2/27/21, 10:47 - Ethan: Ur literally just assuming
2/27/21, 10:47 - Ethan: There r also people who are poor and commit suicide
2/27/21, 10:47 - Ethan: So it doesnt really apply
2/27/21, 10:48 - Ethan: In terms of power over others

3/4/21, 21:11 - Ethan: Shuce me and Elliot have discussed and feel that you do not participate enough in overall group works. You should take initiative to help out. For example, include yourself more in discussions and take initiative to speak up during presentations. Now, this isnt about not bringing your computer. We understand that you have decided to bring your laptop in the previous weeks despite its weight, and we respect your choice not to bring it. We just feel it is necessary to address this issue, as it not only affects you but also us as your group members.
3/4/21, 21:13 - Ethan: Like pls help out more and be more active in group discussions tos

9/17/21, 19:23 - bad: next topic
9/17/21, 19:23 - Ethan: Is evil prison good
9/17/21, 19:23 - Ethan: I don't think so
9/17/21, 19:23 - bad: "Children should be allowed to vote"
9/17/21, 19:23 - Ethan: No
9/17/21, 19:23 - bad: yes
9/17/21, 19:23 - Ethan: Immature
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: children are humans
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: bad
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: how dare u
9/17/21, 19:24 - Ethan: Not mature enough to make educated vote
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: u are a children too
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: no need educated vote
9/17/21, 19:24 - Ethan: Technically untrue
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: just the majority
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: no
9/17/21, 19:24 - Ethan: Aren't children humans 12 and below
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: bad
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: wat
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: children is 18 and below
9/17/21, 19:24 - Ethan: Should choose best government and president
9/17/21, 19:24 - Ethan: Else corruption
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: yes best for children
9/17/21, 19:24 - bad: and adult
9/17/21, 19:25 - bad: very nice
9/17/21, 19:25 - Ethan: Uh
9/17/21, 19:25 - bad: some government bad to children
9/17/21, 19:25 - bad: and thats not good
9/17/21, 19:25 - Ethan: Children referring to what age range
9/17/21, 19:25 - bad: make everyone happy
9/17/21, 19:25 - bad: lemme see
9/17/21, 19:25 - Ethan: If its like 3 years old then it's the same as not letting them do it
9/17/21, 19:25 - Ethan: Because obviously their parents would choose for them
9/17/21, 19:26 - bad: Image result for children age group
Legally, the term child may refer to anyone below the age of majority or some other age limit. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines child as "a human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier".
9/17/21, 19:26 - bad: 18
9/17/21, 19:26 - Ethan: 0 to 18?
9/17/21, 19:26 - bad: yes
9/17/21, 19:26 - Ethan: So you are referring also to infants
9/17/21, 19:26 - Ethan: Infants should be allowed to vote
9/17/21, 19:26 - Ethan: Hmmm
9/17/21, 19:26 - bad: well the thing is
9/17/21, 19:26 - bad: they cant vote
9/17/21, 19:26 - bad: they cant even walk
9/17/21, 19:26 - Ethan: Yes
9/17/21, 19:26 - bad: to the vote center
9/17/21, 19:26 - Ethan: So
9/17/21, 19:26 - Ethan: What range
9/17/21, 19:27 - bad: 6-18?
9/17/21, 19:27 - bad: idk
9/17/21, 19:27 - bad: sounds reasonable
9/17/21, 19:27 - Ethan: 6 seems unreasonable
9/17/21, 19:27 - bad: hmm
9/17/21, 19:27 - Ethan: Honestly, they may just randomly choose
9/17/21, 19:27 - Ethan: Or be heavily influenced by parents
9/17/21, 19:27 - bad: 13-18
9/17/21, 19:27 - Ethan: The latter is more likely
9/17/21, 19:27 - Ethan: Hm
9/17/21, 19:27 - Ethan: Interesting
9/17/21, 19:27 - bad: yes
9/17/21, 19:27 - bad: u
9/17/21, 19:27 - bad: and me
9/17/21, 19:27 - Ethan: They may not be educated enough
9/17/21, 19:28 - bad: hmm
9/17/21, 19:28 - Ethan: About politics
9/17/21, 19:28 - Ethan: So
9/17/21, 19:28 - bad: but they know
9/17/21, 19:28 - bad: some parts
9/17/21, 19:28 - bad: and who is good
9/17/21, 19:28 - Ethan: Not necessarily enough
9/17/21, 19:28 - bad: dosent matter
9/17/21, 19:28 - Ethan: Technically this is subjective
9/17/21, 19:28 - Ethan: So they might just go with their gut
9/17/21, 19:28 - Ethan: Or what the majority is choosing
9/17/21, 19:28 - Ethan: Which basically makes it useless
9/17/21, 19:28 - bad: hmm
9/17/21, 19:29 - bad: but they know about the government
9/17/21, 19:29 - bad: lilke they hear news
9/17/21, 19:29 - Ethan: I mean iys not exactly common for teenagers to listen to the news
9/17/21, 19:29 - Ethan: A large group of them will be completely ignorant
9/17/21, 19:29 - bad: hmm
9/17/21, 19:29 - Ethan: And you cany know who is educated enough and who is not
9/17/21, 19:29 - bad: is one referring to oneself
9/17/21, 19:30 - Ethan: What
9/17/21, 19:30 - bad: yes but theyre still humans
9/17/21, 19:30 - Ethan: So?
9/17/21, 19:30 - Ethan: They are ignorany
9/17/21, 19:30 - bad: so they shld have a choice
9/17/21, 19:30 - bad: if they wanna vote then vote
9/17/21, 19:30 - Ethan: So you would rather equality than efficiency/effectiveness
9/17/21, 19:30 - bad: yes equality good
9/17/21, 19:30 - bad: human rights :D
9/17/21, 19:30 - Ethan: That's not good planninh
9/17/21, 19:31 - bad: also
9/17/21, 19:31 - bad: if children were allowed to vote
9/17/21, 19:31 - bad: they would be more involved in politics
9/17/21, 19:31 - bad: which is good
9/17/21, 19:31 - bad: like theyll prob discuss with others or something
9/17/21, 19:31 - bad: and have views too
9/17/21, 19:31 - Ethan: It will result in entropy
9/17/21, 19:31 - Ethan: Hm
9/17/21, 19:31 - bad: bad
9/17/21, 19:31 - bad: underestingmating children
9/17/21, 19:31 - Ethan: At such a young age they are not very individualistic
9/17/21, 19:32 - Ethan: They may go with the crowd
9/17/21, 19:32 - Ethan: So you see how this can spread across the population
9/17/21, 19:32 - Ethan: Children tend to be more easily affected by those around them
9/17/21, 19:32 - bad: there wont be a crowd unless a government does like
9/17/21, 19:32 - bad: terribly bad
9/17/21, 19:33 - Ethan: Or they are going with tradition
9/17/21, 19:33 - bad: yea so they have a view
9/17/21, 19:33 - bad: and shld vote
9/17/21, 19:33 - Ethan: With is actually very prevalent
9/17/21, 19:33 - Ethan: Yes but it may not be feasible
9/17/21, 19:34 - bad: wdym
9/17/21, 19:34 - bad: just vote
9/17/21, 19:34 - Ethan: They may have a view but that doesn't make the decision correct
9/17/21, 19:34 - bad: write something and put in a box
9/17/21, 19:34 - bad: no ones decision is correct
9/17/21, 19:34 - Ethan: As in the decision
9/17/21, 19:34 - Ethan: Technically untrue
9/17/21, 19:34 - bad: voting is just opinions
9/17/21, 19:34 - bad: majority
9/17/21, 19:34 - bad: i mean it can made such that its optional for children to vote
9/17/21, 19:35 - Ethan: An uncorrupt government is obviously better than a corrupt one
9/17/21, 19:35 - bad: but they should at least be given a chance to vote if they want to
9/17/21, 19:35 - Ethan: Or one that is inefficient
9/17/21, 19:35 - Ethan: Which can be linked to tradtion
9/17/21, 19:35 - bad: yes and i think children understands that
9/17/21, 19:35 - Ethan: Then obviously the parents will pressure the children to vote what they chose
9/17/21, 19:36 - Ethan: Yes they may but their need to fit in may overpower their rationality
9/17/21, 19:41 - Ethan: Hm I just realised I contradicted myself
9/17/21, 19:42 - Ethan: .
9/17/21, 19:48 - Ethan: Uh
9/17/21, 19:48 - Ethan: We are all technically at the center of the univetse
9/17/21, 19:49 - Ethan: Everything is expanding away from us
9/17/21, 19:49 - Ethan: This is because the universe is expanding uniformly
9/17/21, 19:49 - Ethan: So technically it does not have a center; but yet we act as one because that's how centers work - expansion occurs outwards from the centerpoint
9/17/21, 19:51 - Ethan: A way to understand this is via through balloons - when you inflate a  balloon with lots of dots on its surface, the dots are all expanding and moving away from each other uniformly. There is not one unique point where expansion is occurring from
9/17/21, 19:52 - Ethan: Do you understand
9/17/21, 19:53 - Ethan: Also, if the universe is infinite, that means that there may be particles at some point in space arranged exactly the way our earth and its inhabitants are
9/17/21, 19:53 - Ethan: So you can say there will definitely be another you out there
9/17/21, 19:54 - Ethan: Because its infite, so literally anything is possible - every possible combination of particles in spacetime will occur
9/17/21, 19:54 - Ethan: This is called the multiverse theory
9/17/21, 19:55 - Ethan: Very interesting
9/17/21, 21:05 - bad: sowwy i was eating dinner
9/17/21, 21:05 - bad: now im gonna watch tv lol
9/17/21, 21:07 - Ethan: Hm
9/17/21, 21:08 - Ethan: Is that counted as a forfeit
9/17/21, 22:31 - bad: yes

9/22/21, 13:30 - Ethan: ChengWei Species 

This species typically resides in the Amazom forest and is isolated from others from the same species. It spends its day either lazing around on tall branches of the Socratea exorrhiza, a common type of plant found in the forest, or hunting small animals and feeding on Brazil Nuts. Less than 10 of these animals have been identified. However, based on what we have observed so far, the ChengWei was built as an apex predator despite feeding mostly on plants. It has long an curved claws that are perfect for slicing through smaller animal's skins and hard, jagged teeth to cut through hide and crush bones. It has also been seen shining through the forest using vines, screaming at volumes marching that of a fighter jet. When hunting, it usually targets small boars or spider monkeys. It kills quickly and painlessly, slicing the animal's jugular vein with amazing accuracy.

10/10/21, 16:01 - bad: quite sure theres a dash
10/10/21, 16:01 - Ethan: Then try
10/10/21, 16:01 - bad: ok it works with a dash
10/10/21, 16:01 - bad: why do u keep messing up ips

10/10/21, 16:02 - bad: omgomgomgogmg
10/10/21, 16:02 - bad: low iq
10/10/21, 16:06 - Ethan: Why afk
10/10/21, 16:07 - Ethan: Why waste time
10/10/21, 16:07 - Ethan: I have to go soon
10/10/21, 16:40 - bad: had to do stuff
10/10/21, 16:40 - bad: can u minemen
10/10/21, 16:43 - Ethan: cant play already
10/10/21, 16:43 - bad: ok
10/10/21, 17:37 - Ethan: I think my low fps might actually have something to do with the setver
10/10/21, 17:37 - Ethan: On herobrine my fps is on average like 120
10/10/21, 17:37 - Ethan: On the smp it's like 6
10/10/21, 17:37 - bad: i actually get lower fps on herobrine
10/10/21, 17:37 - bad: lol
10/10/21, 17:38 - bad: but both about same
10/10/21, 17:38 - bad: and how the flip do u get 6
10/10/21, 18:12 - Ethan: Exactly
10/10/21, 18:21 - bad: get a better computa :D
10/10/21, 18:29 - Ethan: No
10/10/21, 18:29 - Ethan: This is actually very good
10/10/21, 18:29 - Ethan: Average 120 fps is well above average for laptops
10/10/21, 18:58 - bad: thats only for 1 server lol
10/10/21, 18:58 - bad: and it dosent make sense too
10/10/21, 18:58 - bad: theres 12 ppl on the server and u get 120 fps
10/10/21, 18:58 - bad: but on a server with 3 ppl u get 6 fps
10/10/21, 18:58 - bad: dum computa
10/10/21, 18:59 - Ethan: No I tried others
10/10/21, 18:59 - Ethan: It's the same
10/10/21, 19:00 - Ethan: Exactly so the smp is bad
10/10/21, 19:05 - bad: have u tried on 1.17 servers
10/10/21, 19:05 - bad: i dont think so
10/10/21, 19:05 - bad: everyone else is having constant fps across servers
10/10/21, 19:09 - Ethan: What
10/10/21, 19:09 - Ethan: Doesn't herobrine support 1.17
10/10/21, 19:10 - bad: are u dum or dum
10/10/21, 19:10 - bad: u do realise their base server version is 1.8 right
10/10/21, 19:10 - Ethan: Bru I thought you mean t thus
10/10/21, 19:10 - Ethan: This
10/10/21, 19:10 - bad: and that they are using via version, via backwards, via rewind to allow users of 1.8.x to 1.17.x to join their server
10/10/21, 19:10 - Ethan: So yours is 1.17
10/10/21, 19:10 - bad: yes its base 1.17
10/10/21, 19:11 - Ethan: Can you try to change to 1.8 or does it not work like that
10/10/21, 19:11 - bad: wait no
10/10/21, 19:11 - bad: its 1.16
10/10/21, 19:11 - bad: coz everyone voted for it
10/10/21, 19:11 - bad: so yea
10/10/21, 19:11 - Ethan: .
10/10/21, 19:11 - bad: .
10/10/21, 19:11 - bad: u cannot change it
10/10/21, 19:12 - bad: or all progress will be lost
10/10/21, 19:12 - Ethan: Okay
10/10/21, 19:12 - Ethan: I guess could have to do with base version
10/10/21, 19:12 - Ethan: Sed
10/10/21, 19:12 - bad: not really tho
10/10/21, 19:12 - bad: all servers shld get u the same fps
10/10/21, 19:12 - bad: unless u encounter lots of entities, lag machines or something like that, fps shld be stable
10/10/21, 19:12 - Ethan: Uh well apparently not gor me
10/10/21, 19:13 - Ethan: Hm
10/10/21, 19:13 - bad: then ur computa got problem
10/10/21, 19:13 - bad: :D
10/10/21, 19:13 - bad: check task manager
10/10/21, 19:13 - Ethan: What
10/10/21, 19:13 - Ethan: Why
10/10/21, 19:13 - Ethan: Why would it vary between servers
10/10/21, 19:13 - bad: to see if ur launcher is using too much memory
10/10/21, 19:13 - Ethan: .
10/10/21, 19:13 - bad: because ram usage differs
10/10/21, 19:13 - bad: based on how much stuff it needs to process
10/10/21, 19:14 - Ethan: Doesn't a server process much more
10/10/21, 19:14 - Ethan: Actually maybe not
10/10/21, 19:14 - bad: u do realise fps is processed on ur local computer and not on the server right
10/10/21, 19:14 - Ethan: Ya
10/10/21, 19:14 - Ethan: Its just that there's an obvious difference thete
10/10/21, 19:14 - bad: yea
10/10/21, 19:14 - bad: so theres something wrong
10/10/21, 19:14 - Ethan: So I'm wondering what's the cause for that
10/10/21, 19:14 - bad: but its a u issue coz its not happening to anyone
10/10/21, 19:14 - bad: so u have to investigate :D
10/10/21, 19:14 - Ethan: Yes
10/10/21, 19:15 - bad: so check task manager
10/10/21, 19:15 - bad: also
10/10/21, 19:15 - bad: are u using lunar/optifine
10/10/21, 19:15 - bad: or some other client
10/10/21, 19:15 - bad: that has optfine
10/10/21, 19:15 - Ethan: Also when I'm at a certain spot or facing a certain way in the smp my fps jumps to 100+
10/10/21, 19:16 - bad: ohhh
10/10/21, 19:16 - bad: u shldve said that earlier
10/10/21, 19:16 - bad: breh
10/10/21, 19:16 - Ethan: What
10/10/21, 19:16 - Ethan: Do you know why
10/10/21, 19:16 - bad: its just some entities and direction bugs
10/10/21, 19:16 - bad: with minecraft
10/10/21, 19:16 - bad: its quite common
10/10/21, 19:16 - Ethan: How do I fix it
10/10/21, 19:16 - Ethan: Bru
10/10/21, 19:16 - bad: maybe turn down entity distance
10/10/21, 19:16 - bad: to like 100
10/10/21, 19:16 - Ethan: I see
10/10/21, 19:17 - bad: also show me the location
10/10/21, 19:17 - Ethan: If it works I'm not sure whether to be happy or pissed
10/10/21, 19:17 - Ethan: You know jinghengs base
10/10/21, 19:17 - Ethan: And inside there's this painting which leads to a secret room
10/10/21, 19:18 - Ethan: There's a narrow passageway on the opposite of the room when you enter it
10/10/21, 19:18 - Ethan: It's that area

Count For Points Within Coordinates for a circle, rectangle and triangle c++

c++

I am trying to make a program to count the number of points within a circle, triangle and 4 sided polygon. I have about 3500 coordinates, and i want to be able to find out the count for the number of coordinates within these shapes, e.g. for the circle i want to put the centre coordinates and the radius and find the count. Or for the an square like shape, i currently have a formula to take 4 points, and using bubble sort so that way i can order the way that the area is calculated from the points, but i think I'm going around this the wrong way, i have only just started on this code and will put it up but please bare with as I'm just trying to get my head round it before filling it.
#include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <cstdlib> #include <ctime> using namespace std; void bubblesort(vector<double>& vec) { double s = vec.size(); for (int i=0; i<s; i++) { for (int j=i+1; j<s; j++) { if (vec[i] < vec[j]) { double x = vec[i]; vec[i] = vec[j]; vec[j] = x; } } } } void squarecount(vector<double>& a, vector<double>& b) { // I am thinking here to put the x,y coordinates, linking each two and getting 4 equations counting the number satisfying all 4 inequalities } int main () { double a; cout << "Please enter the corresponding numberthe shape for which you want to find the count of in your data;" << endl; cout << "Circle (1)" << endl; cout << "Triangle (2) " << endl; cout << "4 Sided Polygon (3)" << endl; cin >> a; if ( a == 1) { return 0; } else if (a == 2) { return 0; } else if (a == 3) { vector<double> data1; vector<double> data2; // 4 Sided Polygon double x1, x2, x3, x4, y1, y2, y3, y4; cout << "Enter the first x coordinate then press enter, then the corresponding y coordinate" << endl; cin >> data1[0]; cin >> data2[0]; cout << "Enter the second x coordinate then press enter, then the corresponding y coordinate" << endl; cin >> data1[1]; cin >> data2[1]; cout << "Enter the second x coordinate then press enter, then the corresponding y coordinate" << endl; cin >> data1[2]; cin >> data2[2]; cout << "Enter the second x coordinate then press enter, then the corresponding y coordinate" << endl; cin >> data1[3]; cin >> data2[3]; bubblesort(data1); bubblesort(data2); } else { cout << "Invalid Input!" << endl; cout << "Please enter either 1 for a circle, 2 for a triangle or 3 for a a 4 sided pollygon" << endl; } }

I guess we should assume that the circle is pixelated. Otherwise what do mean by a point.

What's the question? You only need one point and a dimension to find a square. Also, why not use something like std::sort?

First of all if you want to write into a vector you should use push_back(.) or resize the vector first. I am not sure what you want to use the sorting algorithm for.
Also, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. There are existing algorithms to check, if a point is inside a polygon (or a circle). All you need to do is to test this for all your points and count the number of points inside the shape. The circle is trivial: just check if the distance from your point to the center is smaller than the radius. The polygon is a little more complicated: point in polygon. The ray-casting, even-odd rule algorithm could be implemented like this:
#include<iostream> #include<vector> #include<cmath> using namespace std; bool checkPoly(double x, double y, vector<double> xCorners, vector<double> yCorners){ int num=xCorners.size(); int j=num-1; bool res=false; for(int i=0;i<num;i++){ if((yCorners[i]>y) != (yCorners[j]>y) && (x<(xCorners[j]-xCorners[i])*(y-yCorners[i])/(yCorners[j]-yCorners[i])+xCorners[i])){ res = !res; } j=i; } return res; } bool checkCircle(double x, double y, double xCenter, double yCenter, double radius){ if(sqrt(pow(x-xCenter,2)+pow(y-yCenter,2)) < radius){ return true; } return false; } int main(){ //POLYGON vector<double> xCorners; vector<double> yCorners; xCorners.push_back(3); yCorners.push_back(2); xCorners.push_back(5); yCorners.push_back(6); xCorners.push_back(8); yCorners.push_back(4); bool resPoly=false; //CIRCLE double xCenter=5; double yCenter=4; double radius=2.5; bool resCircle=false; for(int x=0;x<10;x++){ for(int y=0;y<10;y++){ resPoly=checkPoly(x,y,xCorners,yCorners); resCircle=checkCircle(x,y,xCenter,yCenter,radius); if(resPoly){ cout<<"("<<x<<", "<<y<<") is inside the polygon."<<endl; }else{ cout<<"("<<x<<", "<<y<<") is outside the polygon."<<endl; } if(resCircle){ cout<<"("<<x<<", "<<y<<") is inside the circle."<<endl; }else{ cout<<"("<<x<<", "<<y<<") is outside the circle."<<endl; } } } return 0;
1/24/22, 17:57 - Ethan: Copid online
1/24/22, 17:58 - bad: what
1/24/22, 17:58 - bad: show code
1/24/22, 17:58 - Ethan: :)
1/24/22, 17:58 - bad: thats unreadbale
1/24/22, 17:58 - Ethan: Breh
1/24/22, 18:47 - bad: btw that has loop
1/24/22, 18:52 - Ethan: rip i tried
1/24/22, 18:53 - bad: sucusucuc
1/24/22, 18:53 - bad: cucc
1/25/22, 06:22 - bad: <Media omitted>
1/25/22, 06:22 - bad: opposite day
1/25/22, 06:22 - bad: yayayaaa
1/25/22, 06:47 - Ethan: Interesting
1/25/22, 06:47 - Ethan: If it's opposite day, does that mean it's not
1/25/22, 06:48 - Ethan: And since today the other days are not opposite days, everyday is an opposite day except today
1/25/22, 06:49 - Ethan: But then you can loop this argument so opposite day is simultaneously today and everyday besides today but never both at the same time
1/25/22, 06:50 - Ethan: This message was deleted
1/25/22, 06:51 - bad: brhw
1/25/22, 06:51 - bad: stop that
1/25/22, 06:51 - bad: today is the one and only opposite day
1/25/22, 06:51 - Ethan: But it's true right
1/25/22, 06:52 - Ethan: So a true opposite day can never exist
1/25/22, 06:52 - Ethan: But it's opposite day
1/25/22, 06:52 - bad: but opposite days will exist
1/25/22, 06:52 - Ethan: So it's not
1/25/22, 06:52 - bad: but no one knows whwb
1/25/22, 06:52 - Ethan: What
1/25/22, 06:52 - Ethan: It's made up by humans
1/25/22, 06:52 - bad: yes
1/25/22, 06:52 - Ethan: It's not actually a thing
1/25/22, 06:52 - Ethan: Just a concept
1/25/22, 06:52 - bad: ur made by human
1/25/22, 06:52 - bad: and u exisy
1/25/22, 06:52 - bad: :D
1/25/22, 06:52 - Ethan: Bre
1/25/22, 06:53 - bad: lol
1/25/22, 06:53 - Ethan: The opposite day we use is not a true one
1/25/22, 06:53 - bad: wdym true one
1/25/22, 06:53 - Ethan: It doesn't work I'm every case
1/25/22, 06:54 - bad: but its opposite day
1/25/22, 06:54 - bad: its a day
1/25/22, 06:54 - Ethan: There are times when it should be neglected
1/25/22, 06:57 - Ethan: Like the rule
1/25/22, 06:57 - Ethan: Bre
1/25/22, 06:57 - bad: what
1/25/22, 06:57 - bad: ruke
1/25/22, 06:57 - bad: rule
1/25/22, 06:57 - Ethan: That everything becomes the opposite of what it was
1/25/22, 06:59 - Ethan: Unless we misunderstood the rule lmao
1/25/22, 06:59 - Ethan: Which we probably did
1/25/22, 06:59 - Ethan: But it's just a thought experiment
1/26/22, 14:37 - Ethan: Is cheng actually not I'm ctp
1/26/22, 14:37 - Ethan: In
1/26/22, 15:01 - Ethan: Also has the teacher replied
1/26/22, 17:27 - bad: yes
1/26/22, 17:27 - bad: no
1/29/22, 12:20 - Ethan: wait isnt it easy
1/29/22, 12:20 - Ethan: just look for keywords
1/29/22, 12:20 - Ethan: or do you mean non vanilla stuff
1/29/22, 12:21 - bad: generate with ai
1/29/22, 12:21 - bad: dude
1/29/22, 12:22 - bad: thats the simple part using nlp
1/29/22, 12:23 - Ethan: wait so how do you use ai to do that
1/29/22, 12:23 - Ethan: isnt it the same
1/29/22, 12:23 - bad: wat
1/29/22, 12:23 - Ethan: you still look for certain words
1/29/22, 12:24 - Ethan: unless you take the whole sentence into account
1/29/22, 12:24 - bad: yes thats rhe first step
1/29/22, 12:24 - Ethan: then that's actual ai
1/29/22, 12:24 - bad: in nlp its called tokens
1/29/22, 12:24 - bad: u need to understand
1/29/22, 12:24 - bad: then sample
1/29/22, 12:24 - Ethan: yes
1/29/22, 12:24 - Ethan: so do you mean vanilla or non vanilla
1/29/22, 12:25 - Ethan: if non vanilla then it's way harder
1/29/22, 12:25 - bad: wdym
1/29/22, 12:25 - bad: its still blocks
1/29/22, 12:25 - Ethan: bre
1/29/22, 12:25 - Ethan: you know you can build vaniall structures on your own using some softwares right
1/29/22, 12:25 - bad: thats not ai
1/29/22, 12:25 - Ethan: like a huge area
1/29/22, 12:25 - Ethan: technically it is
1/29/22, 12:25 - bad: no
1/29/22, 12:25 - Ethan: if it tries to digest the whole sentence
1/29/22, 12:26 - Ethan: like "a village beside a large mountin"
1/29/22, 12:26 - bad: no the hard part is generating
1/29/22, 12:26 - Ethan: oh bre you mean generate using only the ai
1/29/22, 12:26 - bad: yes
1/29/22, 12:26 - Ethan: migth as well use the software
1/29/22, 12:26 - bad: what software
1/29/22, 12:26 - Ethan: find it online
1/29/22, 12:26 - bad: send link
1/29/22, 12:26 - Ethan: if so then it's machine learning
1/29/22, 12:26 - Ethan: right
1/29/22, 12:26 - bad: its ai
1/29/22, 12:26 - bad: ofc
1/29/22, 12:27 - bad: send it
1/29/22, 12:27 - bad: i cant find
1/29/22, 12:27 - Ethan: i saw it in one of forge lab's cideo
1/29/22, 12:28 - bad: justst sendnndkd
1/29/22, 12:28 - Ethan: waitt
1/29/22, 12:29 - Ethan: i think it's world painter
1/29/22, 12:30 - bad: thats literally a worse version of worldedit
1/29/22, 12:31 - bad: its tools to edit the world
1/29/22, 12:31 - bad: not generate stuff
1/29/22, 12:31 - Ethan: you can generate stuff right
1/29/22, 12:31 - bad: no
1/29/22, 12:31 - bad: its not generating
1/29/22, 12:31 - Ethan: let me check
1/29/22, 12:31 - Ethan: did i misunderstand your question
1/29/22, 12:31 - bad: wat
1/29/22, 12:31 - bad: i dont think so
1/29/22, 12:32 - bad: generate structures like
1/29/22, 12:32 - bad: make a spawn
1/29/22, 12:32 - bad: make a bridge or something
1/29/22, 12:32 - Ethan: bre you can generate stuff
1/29/22, 12:32 - bad: where
1/29/22, 12:32 - bad: its not generating with ao
1/29/22, 12:32 - bad: ai
1/29/22, 12:33 - Ethan: ya that's where i misunderstood
1/29/22, 12:33 - bad: genius
1/29/22, 12:33 - Ethan: i thought you meant understand it then send it to some external software for generating
1/29/22, 12:33 - bad: brheehhehehehrh
1/29/22, 12:33 - Ethan: which is way easier
1/29/22, 12:33 - bad: isnt it harder
1/29/22, 12:34 - bad: ok nvm
1/29/22, 12:34 - bad: so
1/29/22, 12:34 - Ethan: bre
1/29/22, 12:34 - bad: there seems to be no software which does this
1/29/22, 12:34 - bad: currently
1/29/22, 12:34 - Ethan: the ai literally has to learn about the structures and how they look like
1/29/22, 12:34 - Ethan: bre
1/29/22, 12:34 - bad: yes
1/29/22, 12:34 - bad: training
1/29/22, 12:34 - bad: and it has generation stuff procedurally
1/29/22, 12:34 - bad: like stff that makes sense
1/29/22, 12:35 - bad: but must have some randomness to it
1/29/22, 12:35 - Ethan: apparently you can actually generate stuff with world painter
1/29/22, 12:35 - Ethan: but it's randomly generated so
1/29/22, 12:35 - bad: its something that dosent make sense
1/29/22, 12:36 - bad: like its not complete
1/29/22, 12:36 - Ethan: yes
1/29/22, 12:36 - bad: hmm
1/29/22, 12:36 - Ethan: wait for the ai to make it's own structures it also has to learn minecraft's physics
1/29/22, 12:36 - Ethan: like how the blocks work and fit together
1/29/22, 12:37 - Ethan: might as well show it sample images and let it copy them it's way faster
1/29/22, 12:39 - bad: by color
1/29/22, 12:39 - bad: and textute
1/29/22, 12:39 - bad: maybe
1/29/22, 12:42 - Ethan: also do you know about gtp-3
1/29/22, 12:42 - Ethan: it's actually cool
1/29/22, 12:42 - Ethan: it literally absorbs information off the internet and use it to answer questions from / interact with the user
1/29/22, 12:44 - bad: yes
1/29/22, 12:44 - bad: i used it
1/29/22, 12:44 - bad: lol
1/29/22, 12:44 - Ethan: hm
1/29/22, 12:44 - Ethan: did you buy it
1/29/22, 12:44 - Ethan: the advanced ones
1/29/22, 12:44 - Ethan: or just the playground
1/29/22, 12:45 - bad: openai.com
1/29/22, 12:45 - Ethan: so the free one
1/29/22, 12:45 - bad: yea
1/29/22, 12:45 - Ethan: apparently there's a more powerful one for like 6 cents per 1000 tokens or something
1/29/22, 12:46 - Ethan: which is quite worth it
1/29/22, 12:46 - bad: idk if i can implement that to generate minecwaft
1/29/22, 12:46 - Ethan: you can it can just find the structures online lol
1/29/22, 12:46 - bad: lol
1/29/22, 12:46 - bad: genius
1/29/22, 12:47 - bad: but i have to download them
1/29/22, 12:47 - bad: and somehow parse them
1/29/22, 12:47 - Ethan: are you sure about that
1/29/22, 12:47 - Ethan: hm
1/29/22, 12:47 - bad: ya
1/29/22, 12:47 - Ethan: wait yea
1/29/22, 12:47 - Ethan: nvm
1/29/22, 12:47 - Ethan: it's just interacctive
1/29/22, 12:48 - Ethan: rip
1/29/22, 12:48 - bad: jzngkdksn
1/29/22, 12:48 - bad: or i can make a bluepriny
1/29/22, 12:49 - bad: or use real life sources
1/29/22, 12:49 - bad: from like google maps.or something
1/29/22, 12:49 - Ethan: what
1/29/22, 12:49 - Ethan: it still has to learn how to translate it
1/29/22, 12:49 - Ethan: like the slant for example
1/29/22, 12:50 - Ethan: you have to show it an example of a conversion first i think idk
2/4/22, 09:03 - Ethan: Missed group voice call
2/6/22, 16:03 - Ethan: Wait what it has been running for 6 years
2/6/22, 16:03 - Ethan: Didn't you change your phone
2/6/22, 16:04 - bad: the phone glitvh
2/6/22, 16:04 - Ethan: Bre how
2/6/22, 16:04 - bad: idk
2/6/22, 16:04 - Ethan: How can the clock app glitch
2/6/22, 16:04 - bad: i just check it once in a while
2/6/22, 20:21 - bad: see discord
2/6/22, 21:48 - Ethan: Can I not do hands on stuff
2/6/22, 21:48 - Ethan: Im too lazy
2/6/22, 21:55 - bad: er
2/6/22, 21:57 - Ethan: Do you have a vague outline for the plan or something
2/6/22, 21:57 - bad: maybe
2/6/22, 21:57 - bad: its a side proj
2/6/22, 21:57 - Ethan: Uh
2/6/22, 21:58 - Ethan: I might think of random stuff
2/6/22, 21:58 - Ethan: For this thing

3/8/22, 10:07 - Ethan: HA
3/8/22, 10:07 - Ethan: IMAGINE NOT GETTING VACCINATED
3/8/22, 10:07 - bad: IMAGINE BEING VACCINATED
3/8/22, 10:07 - bad: AND STILL GETTING COVID
3/8/22, 10:07 - Ethan: Discrimination nation
3/8/22, 10:07 - Ethan: Die
3/8/22, 10:07 - Ethan: Get discriminated
3/8/22, 10:07 - bad: no
3/8/22, 10:08 - bad: discriminate indians
3/8/22, 10:08 - Ethan: Bru the vaccine doesn't prevent the transmitting of covid
3/8/22, 10:08 - Ethan: Bre
3/8/22, 10:08 - Ethan: In fact its better if you get covid
3/8/22, 10:08 - Ethan: Then it was worth it
3/8/22, 10:08 - Ethan: Lmao
3/8/22, 10:08 - bad: wat
3/8/22, 10:08 - Ethan: ..........
3/8/22, 10:08 - Ethan: The vaccine let's your body get used to the virus
3/8/22, 10:08 - Ethan: So the next time around you are more immune tonit
3/8/22, 10:09 - Ethan: Did you not know that
3/8/22, 10:09 - bad: yes
3/8/22, 10:09 - bad: but
3/8/22, 10:09 - Ethan: Ya so the chances of getting covid doesn't change
3/8/22, 10:09 - bad: why would u want to get co id
3/8/22, 10:09 - Ethan: .
3/8/22, 10:09 - bad: whyw
3/8/22, 10:09 - bad: why
3/8/22, 10:09 - bad: 🤦‍♂️
3/8/22, 10:09 - Ethan: Idk makes the vaccine worth ut
3/8/22, 10:09 - bad: breh
3/8/22, 10:09 - Ethan: Unless youre really fragile
3/8/22, 10:09 - bad: hmm

3/8/22, 10:12 - Ethan: Bre
3/8/22, 10:12 - bad: how would that work
3/8/22, 10:12 - bad: maybe thay cancel out

3/30/22, 09:28 - Ethan: What's what mean
3/30/22, 09:28 - bad: nuanceddddd

3/30/22, 09:29 - bad: eh
3/30/22, 09:29 - Ethan: Granular means it's really detailed and technical
3/30/22, 09:29 - Ethan: Bre it's frustrating
3/30/22, 09:29 - bad: wat
3/30/22, 09:29 - bad: its fun

3/30/22, 09:29 - bad: then wgat do u like
3/30/22, 09:29 - Ethan: I should stick with python
3/30/22, 09:29 - Ethan: But it's too simple
3/30/22, 09:30 - bad: therws nothing wrong with that
3/30/22, 09:30 - bad: if it works it works
3/30/22, 09:30 - bad: :D
3/30/22, 09:30 - Ethan: As in it's hard to make small adjustments and stuff
3/30/22, 09:30 - bad: ok
3/30/22, 09:30 - Ethan: It is really intuitive though
3/30/22, 09:30 - bad: ive never used debugging lol
3/30/22, 09:30 - bad: except adding debugging code
3/30/22, 09:31 - Ethan: Wait what
3/30/22, 09:31 - Ethan: How

3/30/22, 11:16 - Ethan: What docs
3/30/22, 11:16 - Ethan: Uh
3/30/22, 11:16 - Ethan: Anyways python is easier for me
3/30/22, 11:16 - bad: documentation
3/30/22, 11:17 - bad: ok
3/30/22, 11:17 - Ethan: I guess
3/30/22, 11:17 - bad: of the library
3/30/22, 11:17 - Ethan: Still the debugging is hard to read
3/30/22, 11:17 - bad: then dont use it :D
3/30/22, 11:17 - bad: just read errors
3/30/22, 11:17 - Ethan: It's easier to just debug directly from the console lol
3/30/22, 11:17 - Ethan: Nah
3/30/22, 11:17 - bad: whywywy
3/30/22, 11:17 - bad: theyre clear
3/30/22, 11:17 - Ethan: Ya but idk how to correct them
3/30/22, 11:17 - Ethan: I know which part is wrong but not how to change it
3/30/22, 11:18 - bad: breh
3/30/22, 11:18 - bad: then be better
3/30/22, 11:18 - Ethan: Also how did you go about creating that ai thing
3/30/22, 11:18 - Ethan: Like chengbot or something
3/30/22, 11:18 - Ethan: Isn't it extremely arduous and complicated
3/30/22, 11:19 - bad: fun fact i still havent made it lol
3/30/22, 11:19 - bad: use keras
3/30/22, 11:19 - bad: or tensorflow
3/30/22, 11:19 - bad: they have backend done already
3/30/22, 11:19 - bad: but u need to underdtand how ai works first
3/30/22, 11:29 - Ethan: It's essentially data mining right
3/30/22, 11:29 - Ethan: Because you already have a source
3/30/22, 12:26 - bad: wat
3/30/22, 12:26 - bad: u need to know neutal networks
3/30/22, 12:26 - bad: forward propagation
3/30/22, 12:27 - bad: basic
3/30/22, 12:28 - Ethan: I mean regarding cheng's messages
3/30/22, 12:28 - Ethan: Like while you are trying to mimick him
3/30/22, 12:29 - bad: isnt that this
3/30/22, 12:29 - Ethan: What's that
3/30/22, 12:29 - bad: googleee
3/30/22, 12:29 - Ethan: I thought its datamininh
3/30/22, 12:29 - bad: thats literally how u train an ai
3/30/22, 12:29 - Ethan: What are you sure
3/30/22, 12:29 - bad: dudueueueue
3/30/22, 12:29 - Ethan: The gtp thing just absorbs into
3/30/22, 12:29 - Ethan: Info
3/30/22, 12:29 - bad: yes
3/30/22, 12:29 - Ethan: I don't think it mimics anyone
3/30/22, 12:29 - Ethan: It's just machine learning
3/30/22, 12:30 - bad: it learns from the data
3/30/22, 12:30 - Ethan: Ya
3/30/22, 12:30 - bad: it perfects the output
3/30/22, 12:30 - Ethan: So it doesn't necessarily mimic
3/30/22, 12:30 - bad: it kinda micmics
3/30/22, 12:30 - Ethan: It just learns English and connects stuff
3/30/22, 12:30 - Ethan: Bre
3/30/22, 12:30 - bad: uh
3/30/22, 12:30 - bad: thats nlp
3/30/22, 12:31 - Ethan: So ai doesn't necessarily mimic humans
3/30/22, 12:31 - Ethan: Thought they do sometimes
3/30/22, 12:31 - bad: its suppose to
3/30/22, 12:31 - bad: the data is from humans
3/30/22, 12:31 - Ethan: They just combine bits of information
3/30/22, 12:31 - Ethan: I guess
3/30/22, 12:31 - Ethan: But it doesn't mimic their behaviour and personalities
3/30/22, 12:31 - bad: the training data affects the ai
3/30/22, 12:31 - Ethan: The personality is the main point here
3/30/22, 12:31 - bad: which affects the output
3/30/22, 12:31 - bad: it can be trained
3/30/22, 12:31 - Ethan: It's emphasis is on the information
3/30/22, 12:32 - Ethan: I guess but then again it can develope one on its own right
3/30/22, 12:32 - Ethan: That's rhe ideal ai
3/30/22, 12:32 - Ethan: Basically a human
3/30/22, 12:32 - bad: then thats self learning
3/30/22, 12:32 - Ethan: Bre ya
3/30/22, 12:32 - Ethan: Developing consciousness
3/30/22, 12:32 - bad: but it has know the basic stuff first
3/30/22, 12:32 - Ethan: Which then leads to an intelligence explosion
3/30/22, 12:33 - Ethan: Ya
3/30/22, 12:33 - bad: so u train jt
3/30/22, 12:33 - bad: it
3/30/22, 12:33 - Ethan: Kind of
3/30/22, 12:33 - Ethan: You just provide info
3/30/22, 12:33 - Ethan: Idk if that's considered training it
3/30/22, 12:33 - bad: data
3/30/22, 12:33 - bad: not info
3/30/22, 12:33 - bad: u pieve of
3/30/22, 12:33 - Ethan: Data is info
3/30/22, 12:33 - Ethan: Lol
3/30/22, 12:33 - bad: no
3/30/22, 12:33 - bad: no
3/30/22, 12:33 - Ethan: Bre
3/30/22, 12:33 - Ethan: Whats the difference then
3/30/22, 12:34 - Ethan: Data is a type of information
3/30/22, 12:34 - bad: idk
3/30/22, 12:34 - Ethan: Bre
3/30/22, 12:34 - bad: data sounds better
3/30/22, 12:34 - Ethan: Anyways
3/30/22, 12:34 - bad: its the correct termm
3/30/22, 12:34 - Ethan: Making an ai is hard
3/30/22, 12:34 - bad: no
3/30/22, 12:34 - Ethan: Even with backend provided
3/30/22, 12:34 - bad: use libraries
3/30/22, 12:34 - bad: its ez
3/30/22, 12:34 - Ethan: Like one that is actually intelligent
3/30/22, 12:34 - bad: just put more data
3/30/22, 12:35 - bad: use the better algorighrm
3/30/22, 12:51 - Ethan: I would say the determining factors of an ai's overall cognitive ability and knowledge depends on it's age and the amount and type of data provided
3/30/22, 12:51 - Ethan: You could out in a lot of useless data and the ai's growth will still remain stagnant
3/30/22, 14:04 - bad: <Media omitted>
3/30/22, 16:57 - bad: <Media omitted>
3/30/22, 16:57 - bad: heheheha

3/31/22, 12:40 - Ethan: Lmao it has a slower clock cycle rip
3/31/22, 12:43 - Ethan: I'm not sure what exactly that means, probably some sort of measure of the time taken to complete small tasks used for cpus
4/5/22, 06:49 - Ethan: Who are you giving it to
4/5/22, 06:49 - Ethan: Whoever it is may try to murder you

4/6/22, 22:13 - Ethan: brebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberberbrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebrebreberberberber
4/6/22, 22:13 - bad: we are using mongoooooooooooooooooooooose
4/6/22, 22:13 - bad: so u need 2 lines of code
4/6/22, 22:13 - Ethan: i need to connect to it first
4/6/22, 22:13 - Ethan: the cluster
4/6/22, 22:13 - bad: u can install the mongodb app
4/6/22, 22:13 - bad: and connect to it
4/6/22, 22:13 - bad: but u have the web panel
4/6/22, 22:13 - bad: ok anyways
4/6/22, 22:13 - bad: first import mongoose
4/6/22, 22:13 - bad: const mongoose = require("mongoose");
4/6/22, 22:14 - bad: then do this
4/6/22, 22:14 - bad: replace process.env.MONGO_CONNECTION with your conn string
4/6/22, 22:14 - bad: are u lost
4/6/22, 22:14 - bad: ok
4/6/22, 22:15 - bad: go to src/structures/BotClient
4/6/22, 22:15 - Ethan: ok i crwated it
4/6/22, 22:15 - bad: put this at the top
4/6/22, 22:15 - bad: /**
   * Initialize mongoose connection and keep it alive
   */
  async initializeMongoose() {
    this.logger.log(`Connecting to MongoDb...`);

    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_CONNECTION, {
      keepAlive: true,
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true
    });

    this.logger.success("Mongoose: Database connection established");
  }
4/6/22, 22:15 - Ethan: uh
4/6/22, 22:15 - bad: paste this somewhere in BotClient.js
4/6/22, 22:15 - Ethan: uh
4/6/22, 22:15 - Ethan: what
4/6/22, 22:15 - bad: go to index.js
4/6/22, 22:15 - bad: add this code above client.login
4/6/22, 22:15 - bad: await client.initializeMongoose();
4/6/22, 22:15 - Ethan: i created a database
4/6/22, 22:15 - Ethan: why
4/6/22, 22:15 - bad: ok good
4/6/22, 22:16 - Ethan: bre
4/6/22, 22:16 - Ethan: lol
4/6/22, 22:16 - bad: do all the steps
4/6/22, 22:16 - bad: and u are connected to the database
4/6/22, 22:16 - bad: pls do it in an ide
4/6/22, 22:16 - Ethan: i already am
4/6/22, 22:16 - bad: no
4/6/22, 22:16 - bad: with nodejs
4/6/22, 22:16 - bad: breh
4/6/22, 22:16 - Ethan: hm
4/6/22, 22:16 - Ethan: can you summarise
4/6/22, 22:16 - bad: what
4/6/22, 22:16 - bad: its just like 3 steps
4/6/22, 22:16 - bad: there
4/6/22, 22:17 - bad: ok so
4/6/22, 22:17 - bad: u download all the files
4/6/22, 22:17 - bad: and u open it in ide
4/6/22, 22:17 - bad: and u run npm install
4/6/22, 22:17 - Ethan: what filEs
4/6/22, 22:17 - bad: the template
4/6/22, 22:17 - bad: github
4/6/22, 22:17 - Ethan: ok then
4/6/22, 22:17 - bad: which u made
4/6/22, 22:17 - bad: open it in ide
4/6/22, 22:17 - bad: run `npm install`
4/6/22, 22:17 - Ethan: mongol right
4/6/22, 22:17 - bad: wat
4/6/22, 22:18 - bad: ok just do this first
4/6/22, 22:18 - Ethan: oh wait
4/6/22, 22:18 - bad: do u have npm
4/6/22, 22:18 - bad: pls tell me u do
4/6/22, 22:18 - Ethan: think so
4/6/22, 22:18 - bad: and nodejs v16.6+
4/6/22, 22:18 - bad: ok run it
4/6/22, 22:18 - bad: does it work
4/6/22, 22:18 - bad: does it install the packages
4/6/22, 22:18 - bad: ok if it does
4/6/22, 22:18 - bad: run `npm install mongoose`
4/6/22, 22:18 - bad: then do the tutorial from here
4/6/22, 22:19 - Ethan: can i not do this
4/6/22, 22:29 - bad: uh
4/6/22, 22:29 - bad: ok
4/6/22, 22:30 - Ethan: why not just use repl
4/6/22, 22:31 - Ethan: actually
4/6/22, 22:31 - bad: breh
4/6/22, 22:31 - Ethan: what
4/6/22, 22:31 - bad: 1. its not even an ide
4/6/22, 22:31 - Ethan: you actually cqan
4/6/22, 22:31 - bad: 2. the server sucks
4/6/22, 22:31 - Ethan: it can store data
4/6/22, 22:31 - bad: 3. its a shared host
4/6/22, 22:31 - bad: what
4/6/22, 22:31 - Ethan: lol it's fine
4/6/22, 22:31 - bad: repl is not a database
4/6/22, 22:31 - Ethan: bre in in teh code itself
4/6/22, 22:31 - Ethan: repl best
4/6/22, 22:31 - bad: what
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: ?
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: what
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: what
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: memory?
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: in the code
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: like
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: type it in
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: what
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: i dont want interaction
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: just information
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: so
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: i like information
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: in the code
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: in a variable
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: yes
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: very simple database
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: as a start
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: breh thats just database
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: i mean
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: memory
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: my coding is subpar
4/6/22, 22:32 - bad: breh
4/6/22, 22:32 - Ethan: what do you expect
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: thats dumb
4/6/22, 22:33 - Ethan: what
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: then why are u doing it
4/6/22, 22:33 - Ethan: it's literally a code
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: storing it in memory
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: is gonna use ur ram
4/6/22, 22:33 - Ethan: id
4/6/22, 22:33 - Ethan: idk
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: bro
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: memory
4/6/22, 22:33 - Ethan: it's fun
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: is ram
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: breh
4/6/22, 22:33 - Ethan: duude
4/6/22, 22:33 - Ethan: i'm going to manually type in the information'
4/6/22, 22:33 - Ethan: into the code itself
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: er
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: so like a config
4/6/22, 22:33 - bad: ok
4/6/22, 22:34 - bad: so no more database
4/6/22, 22:34 - Ethan: it is still a base whcih stores data
4/6/22, 22:34 - Ethan: so
4/6/22, 22:34 - bad: breh
4/6/22, 22:34 - Ethan: hm
4/6/22, 22:34 - bad: thats fake database
4/6/22, 22:34 - Ethan: ok
4/6/22, 22:34 - bad: anwyasys
4/6/22, 22:34 - bad: im gonna sleep
4/6/22, 22:34 - Ethan: ok
4/6/22, 22:34 - bad: have fun
4/6/22, 22:34 - Ethan: no
4/6/22, 22:35 - bad: :(
4/6/22, 22:35 - bad: coding is funnnnnnn
4/6/22, 22:35 - Ethan: i know but not when yoiu're bad
4/6/22, 22:35 - Ethan: also
4/6/22, 22:35 - Ethan: i'll be under your bed tonight
4/6/22, 22:35 - bad: er
4/6/22, 22:35 - Ethan: so be on the lookout
4/6/22, 22:35 - bad: er
4/6/22, 22:35 - bad: no
4/6/22, 22:35 - bad: ill seal it off
4/6/22, 22:35 - bad: also my phone is on 1%
4/6/22, 22:35 - bad: so goodbye
4/6/22, 22:35 - Ethan: nice
4/7/22, 13:11 - Ethan: LOL inagine full time youtuber
4/7/22, 13:15 - bad: YES
4/7/22, 13:15 - bad: HE WILLL BE BEST YOUTUBER
4/7/22, 15:15 - Ethan: <Media omitted>
4/7/22, 15:57 - bad: LOL
4/8/22, 21:40 - Ethan: most ai in games arent actually intelligent
4/8/22, 21:45 - Ethan: do you happen to know how neural networks work because im a bit confused
4/8/22, 21:47 - Ethan: actually more specifically in the field of ai
4/8/22, 21:52 - bad: no shtththhtt
4/8/22, 21:52 - bad: hidden layers
4/8/22, 21:53 - bad: forward propogation
4/8/22, 21:53 - Ethan: uh what
4/8/22, 21:53 - bad: so like u have the first layer
4/8/22, 21:53 - Ethan: you're just spouting jargons
4/8/22, 21:53 - bad: which is the inpit
4/8/22, 21:53 - Ethan: ok
4/8/22, 21:53 - bad: input
4/8/22, 21:53 - Ethan: ok
4/8/22, 21:53 - bad: for example a number
4/8/22, 21:53 - Ethan: ok
4/8/22, 21:53 - bad: then there is the output layer
4/8/22, 21:53 - Ethan: ok
4/8/22, 21:53 - bad: which is obv the result
4/8/22, 21:53 - bad: in between
4/8/22, 21:53 - Ethan: ok
4/8/22, 21:53 - bad: u can have lots of hidden layers
4/8/22, 21:53 - Ethan: why must it be hidden
4/8/22, 21:53 - Ethan: is it random
4/8/22, 21:54 - bad: its just 'hidden'
4/8/22, 21:54 - Ethan: why
4/8/22, 21:54 - bad: it calculates the output
4/8/22, 21:54 - Ethan: is it related to it's randomness
4/8/22, 21:54 - Ethan: oh
4/8/22, 21:54 - bad: no its not random at all
4/8/22, 21:54 - Ethan: oh i see so there's an algorithm
4/8/22, 21:54 - bad: so lets say the hidden layer has 2 nodes
4/8/22, 21:54 - bad: uh
4/8/22, 21:54 - Ethan: taking into account the input
4/8/22, 21:54 - Ethan: is it?
4/8/22, 21:54 - bad: yes
4/8/22, 21:54 - Ethan: oh
4/8/22, 21:54 - bad: which means
4/8/22, 21:54 - Ethan: interesting
4/8/22, 21:55 - bad: the neural network is in fact deterministic
4/8/22, 21:55 - Ethan: ohhhh
4/8/22, 21:55 - bad: but better ai can make it random
4/8/22, 21:55 - Ethan: then why is it "hidden"
4/8/22, 21:55 - Ethan: oh
4/8/22, 21:55 - Ethan: like in games
4/8/22, 21:55 - bad: its a just a term
4/8/22, 21:55 - Ethan: i see
4/8/22, 21:55 - bad: coz u cant see it
4/8/22, 21:55 - bad: lol
4/8/22, 21:55 - Ethan: interesting
4/8/22, 21:55 - bad: lemme draw a diagram
4/8/22, 21:55 - Ethan: so in ai this can make it appear random
4/8/22, 21:55 - Ethan: and more creative in a sensr
4/8/22, 21:55 - bad: pro ai yes
4/8/22, 21:55 - Ethan: mimicking human intelligence
4/8/22, 21:55 - Ethan: interesting
4/8/22, 21:56 - bad: like add a random modifier
4/8/22, 21:56 - Ethan: ohh
4/8/22, 21:56 - Ethan: i see
4/8/22, 21:56 - Ethan: usually they implement decision trees right
4/8/22, 21:56 - bad: acrually lemme just use some online oic
4/8/22, 21:56 - Ethan: so it's really deterministic but the user doesnt know what the variables are
4/8/22, 21:57 - Ethan: ok
4/8/22, 21:57 - bad: <Media omitted>
4/8/22, 21:57 - bad: x1 and x2 are inputs
4/8/22, 21:57 - Ethan: oh i see
4/8/22, 21:58 - bad: the hidden layer has 2 nodes here
4/8/22, 21:58 - Ethan: interesting
4/8/22, 21:58 - bad: f1 and f2
4/8/22, 21:58 - bad: and they are calculated
4/8/22, 21:58 - Ethan: so it's kind of randomised but not really
4/8/22, 21:58 - bad: by the weights
4/8/22, 21:58 - bad: w11 ans w22
4/8/22, 21:58 - Ethan: oh so the nodes have weights
4/8/22, 21:58 - bad: so for example
4/8/22, 21:58 - Ethan: which affects the calculation process
4/8/22, 21:58 - bad: to calculate f1
4/8/22, 21:58 - bad: yes
4/8/22, 21:58 - Ethan: i see
4/8/22, 21:59 - bad: it will be x1*w11 + x2*w21
4/8/22, 21:59 - bad: u can see the arrows
4/8/22, 21:59 - Ethan: ah i see
4/8/22, 21:59 - Ethan: ok tks
4/8/22, 21:59 - bad: then it just keeps going
4/8/22, 21:59 - Ethan: learning this stuff is more fun then actually using it
4/8/22, 21:59 - bad: lol yes
4/8/22, 21:59 - bad: then there is also activation techniques
4/8/22, 22:00 - bad: so u got the result from this but u wanna makw it better
4/8/22, 22:00 - Ethan: uh how
4/8/22, 22:00 - bad: wait lemme find some pics
4/8/22, 22:01 - Ethan: if you run these calculations enough it will eventually produce some form of chaos right
4/8/22, 22:01 - Ethan: interesting
4/8/22, 22:01 - bad: https://www.v7labs.com/blog/neural-networks-activation-functions
4/8/22, 22:01 - bad: no its not chaos
4/8/22, 22:01 - bad: its trained
4/8/22, 22:01 - bad: when ai is trained
4/8/22, 22:01 - Ethan: chaos theory
4/8/22, 22:01 - bad: the weights perfects
4/8/22, 22:01 - Ethan: oh
4/8/22, 22:01 - Ethan: i see
4/8/22, 22:01 - bad: and make the output better
4/8/22, 22:01 - Ethan: wdym better
4/8/22, 22:01 - bad: like
4/8/22, 22:01 - bad: more accuraye
4/8/22, 22:03 - Ethan: can ai process these calculations faster than biological means like electrical signalling or "neurotransmitter diffusion"
4/8/22, 22:03 - Ethan: oh
4/8/22, 22:03 - bad: er well that depends on ur pc
4/8/22, 22:03 - bad: lol
4/8/22, 22:04 - Ethan: so every time it goes through a hidden layer it becomes more ideal
4/8/22, 22:04 - bad: yea
4/8/22, 22:04 - Ethan: ok
4/8/22, 22:04 - bad: some advanced stuff have like thousands of laters
4/8/22, 22:04 - bad: layers
4/8/22, 22:04 - Ethan: hm
4/8/22, 22:04 - bad: theres also backwards propogation btw
4/8/22, 22:04 - bad: u go.backwards
4/8/22, 22:04 - bad: lol
4/8/22, 22:04 - Ethan: how do quantum computers come into play here
4/8/22, 22:05 - bad: idk
4/8/22, 22:05 - Ethan: what
4/8/22, 22:05 - Ethan: quantum entanglement means the transferring of information faster than the speed of light
4/8/22, 22:05 - bad: like imagine recognitoon or something
4/8/22, 22:05 - bad: idk
4/8/22, 22:05 - bad: image recognitok
4/8/22, 22:05 - Ethan: ohhh i see
4/8/22, 22:05 - Ethan: that makes sense
4/8/22, 22:06 - bad: ywa
4/8/22, 22:06 - bad: so the nodes merge
4/8/22, 22:11 - bad: wat u gonna do with ai
4/8/22, 22:12 - Ethan: for the time being i guess ill just dig deeper into this broad concept
4/8/22, 22:12 - bad: nice
4/8/22, 22:12 - Ethan: might apply it in the future if im familiar enough with it
4/8/22, 22:12 - bad: do java
4/8/22, 22:12 - bad: heheheha
4/8/22, 22:12 - Ethan: i might actually there are no exams next week right
4/8/22, 22:12 - bad: yea
4/8/22, 22:12 - Ethan: ok
4/8/22, 22:12 - bad: les do it tmr :D
4/8/22, 22:12 - Ethan: teach me pls
4/8/22, 22:12 - bad: ok
4/8/22, 22:12 - Ethan: im lazy to learn online
4/8/22, 22:12 - bad: ok
4/8/22, 22:13 - bad: be prepared
4/8/22, 22:13 - Ethan: uh when
4/8/22, 22:13 - bad: or u mite suffer
4/8/22, 22:13 - Ethan: uh
4/8/22, 22:13 - Ethan: ok sure
4/8/22, 22:13 - bad: java can makw u rag
4/8/22, 22:13 - bad: rage
4/8/22, 22:13 - bad: like really bad
4/8/22, 22:13 - Ethan: why
4/8/22, 22:13 - Ethan: is it the debugging
4/8/22, 22:13 - bad: becausw of something called null pointer exception
4/8/22, 22:13 - Ethan: i thought it was really good
4/8/22, 22:13 - bad: wat
4/8/22, 22:13 - Ethan: lol ive seen that
4/8/22, 22:14 - bad: er
4/8/22, 22:14 - bad: the thing with plugins
4/8/22, 22:14 - Ethan: oh bre
4/8/22, 22:14 - bad: is that u have to compile it and run on the server and tesr it
4/8/22, 22:14 - bad: so
4/8/22, 22:14 - bad: usually ppl
4/8/22, 22:14 - bad: finish the entire plugin
4/8/22, 22:14 - bad: then run it
4/8/22, 22:14 - Ethan: uh i see
4/8/22, 22:14 - bad: and then take like 10 yeaes to fix everytjing
4/8/22, 22:14 - Ethan: let's start with simple stuff first
4/8/22, 22:14 - bad: ok
4/8/22, 22:14 - Ethan: ah i see
4/8/22, 22:15 - Ethan: so is it the debugging's issue
4/8/22, 22:15 - bad: lets make stucknight kicker
4/8/22, 22:15 - bad: idk
4/8/22, 22:15 - bad: i dont use it lol
4/8/22, 22:15 - Ethan: ok
4/8/22, 22:15 - Ethan: bre just like print something in game lol
4/8/22, 22:15 - bad: yea ppl do that
4/8/22, 22:15 - Ethan: you can right
4/8/22, 22:15 - bad: but everytime u change a code
4/8/22, 22:15 - bad: u havw to recompile
4/8/22, 22:15 - bad: and upload it
4/8/22, 22:15 - bad: and reload
4/8/22, 22:15 - Ethan: so what just finish it first
4/8/22, 22:16 - bad: which prob takes about 2 min
4/8/22, 22:16 - bad: yea
4/8/22, 22:21 - Ethan: how does machine learning occur if the outputs of the neural networks are predetermined
4/8/22, 22:22 - bad: wat
4/8/22, 22:22 - bad: u learn different data
4/8/22, 22:23 - Ethan: so does it draw its own conclusion
4/8/22, 22:24 - bad: wdym
4/8/22, 22:25 - Ethan: basically does it learn to do things that it was not programmed to
4/8/22, 22:25 - bad: it learns by itself
4/8/22, 22:25 - bad: its not alive
4/8/22, 22:26 - Ethan: e.g. learning from experience that the ideal outputs follow a certain output and extrapolate the required outputs in the future
4/8/22, 22:26 - bad: um
4/8/22, 22:26 - bad: isnr extrapolating
4/8/22, 22:26 - bad: just neural.netowrks
4/8/22, 22:26 - Ethan: i thought it is provided with desired outputs for a lot of scenarios
4/8/22, 22:26 - bad: yea
4/8/22, 22:26 - Ethan: hm
4/8/22, 22:26 - Ethan: so it's still following a carved process
4/8/22, 22:27 - Ethan: is there not a stage where it learns by itself without extra provided demands
4/8/22, 22:28 - bad: i think thats fine tuning
4/8/22, 22:28 - bad: or something
4/8/22, 22:28 - Ethan: "Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.
4/8/22, 22:28 - bad: idk
4/8/22, 22:28 - Ethan: interesting
4/8/22, 22:28 - Ethan: so it's extrapolation
4/8/22, 22:28 - Ethan: interesting
4/8/22, 22:28 - Ethan: very interesting
4/8/22, 22:29 - Ethan: that's just us running it a greater amount of times right
4/8/22, 22:29 - bad: yea
4/8/22, 22:29 - Ethan: im confused about the part where it draws a connection and discovers the patterns
4/8/22, 22:29 - Ethan: how does it make that jump in its intelligence
4/8/22, 22:32 - Ethan: i think the way ai like gtp3 works is that it absorbs all these information online and sifts through it numerous times, possibly finding the answer to certain inputs that occured the most amounts of times
4/8/22, 22:32 - Ethan: or it links them to positive or ideal feedback which is another level of intelligence altogether
4/8/22, 22:33 - Ethan: or simply it is provided ideal outputs and just uses backwards propagation but that doesnt seem likely seeing all the information it is provided by the internet
4/8/22, 22:33 - Ethan: the whole point of it is to minimise human interaction i would guess
4/8/22, 22:36 - Ethan: GPT-3 Architecture
The architecture of GPT-3 is made up of two main parts, an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the previous word in the sentence as input and converts it into a vector representation, which is then passed through an attention process to generate the next word prediction. The decoder takes the previous word as well as its vector representation as input and outputs a probability distribution over possible words given those inputs. The GPT-3 API offers a general-purpose “text in, text out” interface that can be used for almost any language mission. Most other language APIs, on the other hand, are designed for a single purpose, such as sentiment classification or named entity recognition. To use the API, simply provide it with a text prompt (the text-based input or instructions), and it will return a text completion that attempts to fit the context or pattern you provided. It can be programmed by writing a summary or a few examples of what you want it to do. Its performance is largely determined by the task’s complexity. You may expect a more reliable answer if you have a more specific example. As GPT-3 training data cuts off in October 2019, the API may not have knowledge of current events.
4/8/22, 22:36 - Ethan: interesting

4/12/22, 19:29 - Ethan: it measures several aspects of your intelligence
4/12/22, 19:29 - Ethan: moe stuff
4/12/22, 19:29 - Ethan: whywhywhy
4/12/22, 19:29 - Ethan: my quantitative analysis and perhaps numerical reasoning arent that great either
4/12/22, 19:30 - bad: hmm
4/12/22, 19:31 - bad: wat
4/12/22, 19:31 - bad: breh
4/12/22, 19:31 - Ethan: what
4/12/22, 19:31 - bad: these test fake
4/12/22, 19:31 - bad: not accurate
4/12/22, 19:31 - bad: bad
4/12/22, 19:31 - Ethan: what
4/12/22, 19:31 - Ethan: why
4/12/22, 19:31 - Ethan: it's pretty broad though
4/12/22, 19:31 - Ethan: and it was selected by the moe
4/12/22, 19:31 - bad: too many external factors affecting
4/12/22, 19:31 - Ethan: that applies for all tests
4/12/22, 19:31 - bad: moe suc
4/12/22, 19:31 - Ethan: also this is cultural test
4/12/22, 19:32 - Ethan: but we are all from the same culture anyways
4/12/22, 19:32 - bad: chinese sueprirotiyy
4/12/22, 19:32 - bad: heheheha

4/12/22, 20:44 - Ethan: run it
4/12/22, 20:44 - Ethan: rim it
4/12/22, 20:44 - Ethan: run it
4/12/22, 20:44 - bad: ill just see the code
4/12/22, 20:44 - bad: wait
4/12/22, 20:45 - bad: ok
4/12/22, 20:45 - bad: so
4/12/22, 20:45 - bad: small issue
4/12/22, 20:45 - Ethan: uh
4/12/22, 20:45 - bad: actualy its not really an issue
4/12/22, 20:45 - Ethan: go on
4/12/22, 20:46 - bad: the code works
4/12/22, 20:46 - Ethan: nice
4/12/22, 20:46 - bad: but usually people dont all the events in one file
4/12/22, 20:46 - bad: especially in the main class
4/12/22, 20:46 - Ethan: why
4/12/22, 20:46 - Ethan: it's so short
4/12/22, 20:46 - bad: well for this plugin yes
4/12/22, 20:46 - Ethan: i see
4/12/22, 20:46 - bad: but any normal plugin wouldnt be so short
4/12/22, 20:46 - Ethan: ok
4/12/22, 20:46 - bad: or what u want to do is
4/12/22, 20:46 - Ethan: invite me to the server pls
4/12/22, 20:46 - bad: wat server
4/12/22, 20:46 - Ethan: i want to test it myself
4/12/22, 20:46 - bad: i didnt even run it lol
4/12/22, 20:46 - Ethan: or add it in a server first
4/12/22, 20:47 - bad: i just read the code
4/12/22, 20:47 - Ethan: plsplspls
4/12/22, 20:47 - Ethan: plsplslps
4/12/22, 20:47 - bad: breh
4/12/22, 20:47 - Ethan: cherry on top
4/12/22, 20:47 - bad: ok
4/12/22, 20:48 - bad: @EventHandler
  public void onPlayerPunch(PlayerMoveEvent e) {
    e.getPlayer().sendMessage("Your punches are weak.");
  }
4/12/22, 20:48 - bad: um
4/12/22, 20:48 - bad: why isit a playermoveevent
4/12/22, 20:49 - bad: 104.143.2.68
4/12/22, 20:49 - bad: get on
4/12/22, 20:50 - Ethan: what
4/12/22, 20:50 - bad: what
4/12/22, 20:50 - bad: its a punch
4/12/22, 20:50 - bad: why isit move event
4/12/22, 20:50 - Ethan: what should it be
4/12/22, 20:50 - bad: technically
4/12/22, 20:50 - bad: u cant detect punches
4/12/22, 20:50 - bad: but
4/12/22, 20:50 - bad: u can detect when u hit something
4/12/22, 20:51 - bad: and the event would be
4/12/22, 20:51 - bad: EntityDamageByEntityEvent
4/12/22, 20:51 - Ethan: oh
4/12/22, 20:51 - bad: join
4/12/22, 20:51 - Ethan: so ewhat does onplayerpunch do
4/12/22, 20:51 - bad: it sends u "your punches are weak" when u try to move
4/12/22, 20:51 - bad: lol
4/12/22, 20:51 - Ethan: bre then what's the point of that
4/12/22, 20:51 - bad: theres no point
4/12/22, 20:51 - bad: exactly
4/12/22, 20:52 - Ethan: brbrbre
4/12/22, 20:52 - bad: @EventHandler
  public void onPlayerMove(PlayerMoveEvent e) {
    e.setCancelled(true);
    e.getPlayer().sendMessage("" + ChatColor.RED + "Stop moving");
  }
4/12/22, 20:52 - bad: this thing is gay
4/12/22, 20:52 - bad: stop me from moving
4/12/22, 20:52 - Ethan: LOL
4/12/22, 20:52 - bad: >:(
4/12/22, 20:52 - bad: joinnn
4/12/22, 20:52 - Ethan: waittt
4/12/22, 20:52 - bad: also for this
4/12/22, 20:52 - bad: public void onEnable() {
    Bukkit.getPluginManager().registerEvents(this, (Plugin)this);
  }
4/12/22, 20:52 - bad: it is recommended to put @Override
4/12/22, 20:53 - bad: annotation
4/12/22, 20:53 - Ethan: what why
4/12/22, 20:53 - bad: @Override
public void onEnable() {
    Bukkit.getPluginManager().registerEvents(this, (Plugin)this);
}
4/12/22, 20:53 - Ethan: oh i see
4/12/22, 20:53 - bad: yes
4/12/22, 20:53 - Ethan: ok makes sense

4/12/22, 21:03 - bad: what did u change
4/12/22, 21:03 - Ethan: removed the annoying codes
4/12/22, 21:03 - bad: i see
4/12/22, 21:03 - bad: u didnt add the speaktrush command in plugin.yml
4/12/22, 21:03 - bad: btw
4/12/22, 21:03 - bad: so it wont register
4/12/22, 21:04 - Ethan: ahhhh

4/12/22, 21:04 - bad: if (sender instanceof Player) {

4/12/22, 21:04 - bad: for this code
4/12/22, 21:04 - bad: which i assume u copied from the course
4/12/22, 21:05 - bad: theres a shorter but prob less readable depending on u way of expressing it
4/12/22, 21:05 - bad: if (!(sender instanceof Player player)) return false;
4/12/22, 21:05 - bad: like this
4/12/22, 21:05 - bad: it inits player and also checks if sender is a instance of player
4/12/22, 21:05 - bad: all if one line
4/12/22, 21:05 - bad: :D
4/12/22, 21:06 - Ethan: oh i see
4/12/22, 21:06 - Ethan: wait isnt there the { } thing
4/12/22, 21:06 - Ethan: for the lines in between
4/12/22, 21:06 - Ethan: also add the edited codes
4/12/22, 21:06 - bad: wat
4/12/22, 21:06 - bad: yea
4/12/22, 21:06 - bad: uh
4/12/22, 21:06 - Ethan: add
4/12/22, 21:06 - bad: for single line statements u can dont put them
4/12/22, 21:06 - bad: like
4/12/22, 21:06 - bad: if (condition) do;
4/12/22, 21:07 - bad: but for multi line u have to
4/12/22, 21:07 - Ethan: o
4/12/22, 21:07 - bad: if (condition) {
 do
 do
}
4/12/22, 21:07 - Ethan: that makes sese

4/12/22, 21:07 - bad: no it just
4/12/22, 21:07 - bad: increases code readability
4/12/22, 21:07 - bad: and it looks nicer
4/12/22, 21:07 - Ethan: it's fine
4/12/22, 21:07 - Ethan: just run first

4/12/22, 21:23 - bad: ok
4/13/22, 19:22 - Ethan: do you have anything to make for your mc plugin
4/13/22, 19:22 - Ethan: i want to try making a simple project
4/13/22, 19:25 - bad: oh
4/13/22, 19:25 - bad: isnt there some projects in the course
4/13/22, 19:25 - Ethan: yes but specifically for events
4/13/22, 19:26 - bad: uh
4/13/22, 19:26 - bad: u cant just make something with events
4/13/22, 19:26 - bad: everything is integrated tgt
4/13/22, 19:26 - Ethan: bre
4/13/22, 19:26 - Ethan: basically what i did
4/13/22, 19:26 - bad: uh
4/13/22, 19:27 - bad: the plugin has no real use
4/13/22, 19:27 - Ethan: hm
4/13/22, 19:27 - Ethan: why tho
4/13/22, 19:27 - Ethan: why cant it be just events
4/13/22, 19:27 - bad: how do u make something with just events
4/13/22, 19:27 - Ethan: why not
4/13/22, 19:27 - Ethan: onplayerx
4/13/22, 19:28 - bad: its simply a function
4/13/22, 19:28 - bad: a utility
4/13/22, 19:28 - Ethan: what
4/13/22, 19:28 - bad: events
4/13/22, 19:28 - Ethan: onplayerxevent
4/13/22, 19:28 - bad: yes
4/13/22, 19:28 - Ethan: proceed to do a task'
4/13/22, 19:28 - Ethan: i see
4/13/22, 19:28 - Ethan: still it works
4/13/22, 19:28 - Ethan: and can be useful
4/13/22, 19:28 - bad: it woeks
4/13/22, 19:28 - bad: but no point
4/13/22, 19:28 - Ethan: i guess moslty such projects are for commands right
4/13/22, 19:28 - bad: ive some example proj
4/13/22, 19:28 - Ethan: like custom plugins
4/13/22, 19:28 - bad: from the course
4/13/22, 19:29 - bad: Freeze Wand

The idea of a freeze wand is pretty simple, you just click a player with the wand, and they cannot move until they are unfrozen with the wand. This could be useful in a staff utility plugin, or just as a fun feature. This project is nice because it can be solved in a very simple, easy way - but can also be an opportunity to begin exploring OOP and further understanding it. The working solution provided is an OOP solution. 

Here's how it works:
- You click a player with a stick
- The player is frozen/unfrozen depending on what they currently are

Required Features:
- Store "profiles" for players
- Have the "profile" contain the frozen state of the player
- Able to toggle a player's frozen state by clicking them with a stick
- Cancel the player's movement if they are frozen

This is all pretty simple usage of the Spigot API, but should hopefully push you to explore more with Java and OOP.

Good luck! heart 

Hints (click to view):
- You can check the item Material of the player's main hand with Player#getInventory()#getItemInMainHand()#getType()
- You can create a ProfileHandler with a Map to store and manage your profiles
- PlayerInteractEvents, whether that be AtEntity or not, fire once for each hand (twice in total)

4/13/22, 20:51 - bad: oh god
4/13/22, 20:51 - bad: static abuse
4/13/22, 20:51 - Ethan: lol
4/13/22, 20:51 - Ethan: it still works right
4/13/22, 20:51 - bad: one of the beginner issues
4/13/22, 20:51 - Ethan: what
4/13/22, 20:51 - bad: even if it works, its terrible
4/13/22, 20:51 - Ethan: why
4/13/22, 20:51 - bad: here
4/13/22, 20:51 - bad: read about static
4/13/22, 20:51 - bad: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-keyword-java/#:~:text=The%20static%20keyword%20in%20Java,an%20instance%20of%20the%20class.
4/13/22, 20:51 - bad: dont static abuse
4/13/22, 20:51 - bad: its bad
4/13/22, 20:52 - bad: i can remake this
4/13/22, 20:52 - bad: come discord
4/13/22, 20:52 - Ethan: but does it work
4/13/22, 20:52 - bad: watch the correct way
4/13/22, 20:53 - Ethan: i just want to know iuf my logic is correct
4/13/22, 20:53 - Ethan: brebrer
4/13/22, 20:53 - bad: honestly
4/13/22, 20:53 - bad: static abuse is worse
4/13/22, 20:53 - bad: its bad ok
4/13/22, 20:53 - Ethan: lol
4/13/22, 20:53 - bad: like very bad
4/13/22, 20:53 - Ethan: what will happen
4/13/22, 20:53 - Ethan: oh will they clash with each other
4/13/22, 20:54 - bad: no
4/13/22, 20:54 - bad: it violates oop programming
4/13/22, 20:54 - bad: ok first
4/13/22, 20:54 - bad: do u know what static does
4/13/22, 20:54 - Ethan: ya i think so
4/13/22, 20:54 - Ethan: prioritises or something right
4/13/22, 20:54 - bad: ok what does it do
4/13/22, 20:54 - bad: uh
4/13/22, 20:54 - Ethan: "it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object
4/13/22, 20:55 - bad: yes but u cant say priotise
4/13/22, 20:55 - bad: it creates a shared variable/method
4/13/22, 20:55 - bad: of the class
4/13/22, 20:55 - bad: means
4/13/22, 20:55 - bad: all instances of the class
4/13/22, 20:55 - bad: share this static variable
4/13/22, 20:56 - bad: now
4/13/22, 20:56 - Ethan: hm
4/13/22, 20:56 - bad: u only use static when
4/13/22, 20:56 - bad: when its a constant
4/13/22, 20:56 - Ethan: i see
4/13/22, 20:56 - bad: and all instances of the class share thsi variable
4/13/22, 20:56 - Ethan: ine are constants what
4/13/22, 20:56 - bad: static abuse *can* lead to terrible errors
4/13/22, 20:56 - Ethan: mine
4/13/22, 20:56 - bad: since you are modifying the static variable across are instnaces of the class
4/13/22, 20:56 - bad: public static void init() {
    createWand();
  }
4/13/22, 20:57 - Ethan: uh ok
4/13/22, 20:57 - bad: private static void createWand() {
4/13/22, 20:57 - bad: event this honestly
4/13/22, 20:57 - bad: public static ItemStack wand;
4/13/22, 20:57 - Ethan: oh i see
4/13/22, 20:57 - bad: theres really no need for static
4/13/22, 20:57 - Ethan: so
4/13/22, 20:57 - Ethan: can you run it
4/13/22, 20:57 - bad: also
4/13/22, 20:57 - bad: what is this init for
4/13/22, 20:57 - Ethan: not sure
4/13/22, 20:57 - bad: u can use a class constructor
4/13/22, 20:57 - Ethan: i was dollwing a tutorial
4/13/22, 20:57 - bad: um
4/13/22, 20:57 - bad: from youtube?
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: yes
4/13/22, 20:58 - bad: omg
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: items
4/13/22, 20:58 - bad: thats bad
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: why
4/13/22, 20:58 - bad: very bad
4/13/22, 20:58 - bad: dont learn from youtube
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: lol what
4/13/22, 20:58 - bad: they have TERRIBLE coding practices
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: why
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: hmm
4/13/22, 20:58 - bad: ur going to get bad influence
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: just RUN IT
4/13/22, 20:58 - bad: no
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: ok sure
4/13/22, 20:58 - bad: i need to recode it
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: why
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: honestly'
4/13/22, 20:58 - bad: come discord
4/13/22, 20:58 - Ethan: it will run right
4/13/22, 20:59 - bad: i just realised somethiing
4/13/22, 20:59 - bad: your class names
4/13/22, 20:59 - bad: WHY ARE THEY LOWERCASE
4/13/22, 20:59 - Ethan: so what
4/13/22, 20:59 - Ethan: what's wrong
4/13/22, 20:59 - bad: THATS WRONG
4/13/22, 20:59 - bad: ITS UPPERCAMELCASE U SHIT
4/13/22, 20:59 - Ethan: why
4/13/22, 20:59 - bad: THATS HOW JAVA WORKS
4/13/22, 20:59 - Ethan: uh ok
4/13/22, 20:59 - bad: DOESNT THE IDE SCREAM AT U
4/13/22, 20:59 - Ethan: so it wont work in lowercase?
4/13/22, 21:00 - Ethan: no
4/13/22, 21:00 - bad: TO CHANGE THE NAMES
4/13/22, 21:00 - bad: IDK NOBODY TESTED IT BECAUSE ITS DUMB
4/13/22, 21:00 - bad: IT SHLDNT WORK
4/13/22, 21:00 - Ethan: bru what
4/13/22, 21:00 - bad: IN FACT
4/13/22, 21:00 - Ethan: bre but why
4/13/22, 21:00 - Ethan: why the random rules
4/13/22, 21:00 - bad: its not random
4/13/22, 21:00 - Ethan: then why
4/13/22, 21:00 - bad: its a standardised convention
4/13/22, 21:00 - Ethan: yes but why
4/13/22, 21:00 - bad: that everyone uses upper camel case
4/13/22, 21:01 - Ethan: bre
4/13/22, 21:01 - bad: readibility?
4/13/22, 21:01 - bad: very important in code
4/13/22, 21:01 - Ethan: personally lowercase is fine
4/13/22, 21:01 - Ethan: :/
4/13/22, 21:01 - bad: no its not
4/13/22, 21:01 - bad: code is not for u
4/13/22, 21:01 - bad: code is also for others to read
4/13/22, 21:01 - Ethan: that depends
4/13/22, 21:01 - bad: u cant code something that only u understand
4/13/22, 21:01 - bad: if its so messy
4/13/22, 21:01 - bad: u prob will forget what u coded
4/13/22, 21:02 - bad: code readibility also somewhat has to do with code orthogonality
4/13/22, 21:02 - bad: if its messy, its not easily expandable
4/13/22, 21:03 - Ethan: why
4/13/22, 21:03 - bad: .
4/13/22, 21:03 - bad: also
4/13/22, 21:03 - Ethan: what does that mean'
4/13/22, 21:03 - bad: have a look at the SOLID principles
4/13/22, 21:03 - bad: it applies to all OOP programming
4/13/22, 21:04 - bad: code orthoganality basically means how easily its expandable
4/13/22, 21:04 - bad: actually
4/13/22, 21:04 - bad: only the first one is important for now
4/13/22, 21:04 - bad: at least
4/13/22, 21:04 - Ethan: why would the absense of uppercase affect how expandable it is
4/13/22, 21:04 - Ethan: absence
4/13/22, 21:04 - bad: im talking about code readiliy in general
4/13/22, 21:04 - Ethan: oh bre
4/13/22, 21:04 - bad: absence of uppercase is even worse than code readiblity
4/13/22, 21:05 - Ethan: lol
4/13/22, 21:05 - Ethan: not for me tho
4/13/22, 21:05 - Ethan: hm
4/13/22, 21:05 - bad: if anyone sees that, i gurantee theyll rip your heart out
4/13/22, 21:05 - Ethan: hm ok
4/13/22, 21:05 - bad: so
4/13/22, 21:05 - bad: which is single responsibiility principle
4/13/22, 21:05 - bad: all methods and classes should only serve one responsibility
4/13/22, 21:05 - Ethan: also
4/13/22, 21:05 - Ethan: did you ask cheng to rig the votes
4/13/22, 21:05 - bad: what
4/13/22, 21:05 - bad: what votes
4/13/22, 21:05 - Ethan: evilkingdom thing
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: what
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: the poll
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: i just made?
4/13/22, 21:06 - Ethan: yes
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: like just now
4/13/22, 21:06 - Ethan: yes
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: wat
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: no
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: why
4/13/22, 21:06 - Ethan: i can see your screen
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: um
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: thats not rigging
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: lol
4/13/22, 21:06 - Ethan: bre
4/13/22, 21:06 - Ethan: bre
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: rigging is him abusing his admin power
4/13/22, 21:06 - Ethan: anyways
4/13/22, 21:06 - Ethan: want do you want me to do now
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: and removing other ppls votes
4/13/22, 21:06 - Ethan: what
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: also focus on the current topic
4/13/22, 21:06 - bad: u piece of
4/13/22, 21:06 - Ethan: ok
4/13/22, 21:07 - bad: so single responsibility
4/13/22, 21:07 - bad: .
4/13/22, 21:07 - Ethan: ok
4/13/22, 21:07 - bad: so
4/13/22, 21:07 - bad: on your onEnable method
4/13/22, 21:07 - Ethan: why not just cram it all tho
4/13/22, 21:07 - bad: u violated that soemwhat
4/13/22, 21:07 - Ethan: oh
4/13/22, 21:07 - bad: THATS EXACTLY WHAT U NOT WANT TO DO
4/13/22, 21:07 - Ethan: uh
4/13/22, 21:07 - Ethan: why
4/13/22, 21:07 - bad: its a principle
4/13/22, 21:07 - bad: dont questio
4/13/22, 21:07 - Ethan: bre ok
4/13/22, 21:07 - bad: lol
4/13/22, 21:07 - bad: ok
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: another important thing about java
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: is
4/13/22, 21:08 - Ethan: this is just unimportant stuff bre
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: encapsulation
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: no
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: its important
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: its the foundation
4/13/22, 21:08 - Ethan: why
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: of oop programming
4/13/22, 21:08 - Ethan: ok then
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: if u dont know this, its going to be hard
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: not hard,
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: just
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: bad code quality
4/13/22, 21:08 - Ethan: bre that's subjective
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: wait have u learnt lists
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: and hashmaps
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: sets
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: all that
4/13/22, 21:08 - Ethan: in code no
4/13/22, 21:08 - bad: in java
4/13/22, 21:08 - Ethan: no
4/13/22, 21:09 - bad: breh ok
4/13/22, 21:09 - bad: theyre very simple
4/13/22, 21:09 - bad: public List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
4/13/22, 21:09 - Ethan: wait i know that
4/13/22, 21:09 - bad: public Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
4/13/22, 21:09 - bad: all the same
4/13/22, 21:10 - bad: remember that its new ArrayList
4/13/22, 21:10 - bad: not new List
4/13/22, 21:10 - bad: List is a interface
4/13/22, 21:10 - bad: it cant be initialized
4/13/22, 21:10 - bad: ArrayList is a implementation of it
4/13/22, 21:10 - bad: wait
4/13/22, 21:10 - bad: have u learnt abstraction and interfaces
4/13/22, 21:10 - Ethan: ok
4/13/22, 21:10 - Ethan: bre NO
4/13/22, 21:10 - bad: breh
4/13/22, 21:10 - bad: ok
4/13/22, 21:10 - bad: uh
4/13/22, 21:11 - bad: ill just cover these in a later date
4/13/22, 21:11 - bad: anyways lemme recode ur thing
4/13/22, 21:11 - Ethan: why are we even in a call
4/13/22, 21:11 - bad: to screenshare
4/13/22, 21:11 - Ethan: oh
4/13/22, 21:11 - Ethan: ok
4/13/22, 21:11 - bad: CHENG REPLICED

4/20/22, 17:39 - Ethan: hm i actually can
4/20/22, 17:40 - bad: idk how ur suppose to do pychology online
4/20/22, 17:40 - Ethan: or even better research paper
4/20/22, 17:40 - Ethan: thesis
4/20/22, 17:40 - bad: er
4/20/22, 17:40 - Ethan: for phd
4/20/22, 17:40 - Ethan: :D
4/20/22, 17:40 - bad: er
4/20/22, 17:40 - bad: er

4/20/22, 17:40 - Ethan: no
4/20/22, 17:40 - Ethan: requires like what 4 5 years?
4/20/22, 17:40 - bad: maybe

4/20/22, 17:40 - Ethan: ahhh
4/20/22, 17:40 - bad: make ur own test
4/20/22, 17:40 - bad: LOL
4/20/22, 17:40 - Ethan: ?
4/20/22, 17:40 - Ethan: what test

4/20/22, 17:41 - bad: lol
4/20/22, 17:41 - Ethan: i could but im not exactly an expert
4/20/22, 17:41 - Ethan: and that requires coding
4/20/22, 17:41 - Ethan: hm
4/20/22, 17:41 - bad: so what can u dodooooo
4/20/22, 17:41 - bad: with pychology
4/20/22, 17:41 - Ethan: idk research paper
4/20/22, 17:41 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 17:41 - bad: thats it
4/20/22, 17:41 - Ethan: i did do that for a while previously
4/20/22, 17:41 - bad: and typing
4/20/22, 17:41 - Ethan: but gave up
4/20/22, 17:41 - bad: dont u hate tgat
4/20/22, 17:41 - Ethan: no it's fun
4/20/22, 17:41 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 17:41 - Ethan: information dump :D
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: .
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: use speech
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: talk
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: :D
4/20/22, 17:42 - Ethan: yes but it's easier and less choppy as compared to coding
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: why
4/20/22, 17:42 - Ethan: tts
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: coidng is funnnnnn
4/20/22, 17:42 - Ethan: LOL
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: er
4/20/22, 17:42 - Ethan: i concede
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: no
4/20/22, 17:42 - Ethan: but it's physically taxing
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: u may not
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: why
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: its some logic shit
4/20/22, 17:42 - Ethan: bre means i agress
4/20/22, 17:42 - Ethan: brebrebrebebebeebebe
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: u need to start simple
4/20/22, 17:42 - bad: i think
4/20/22, 17:42 - Ethan: ya but there's esoteric concepts all over the place
4/20/22, 17:43 - bad: u are similar to cheng
4/20/22, 17:43 - bad: cheng likez to do stuff thats beyond his capablities
4/20/22, 17:43 - Ethan: lol
4/20/22, 17:43 - bad: intelligence
4/20/22, 17:43 - Ethan: same
4/20/22, 17:43 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 17:43 - Ethan: simple stuff is boring
4/20/22, 17:43 - bad: ya but
4/20/22, 17:43 - Ethan: are
4/20/22, 17:43 - bad: u need foundation
4/20/22, 17:43 - Ethan: but usually i suceed
4/20/22, 17:43 - Ethan: :D
4/20/22, 17:43 - Ethan: like the arduino thing
4/20/22, 17:43 - bad: thats why not many ppl can become real proframmer
4/20/22, 17:43 - Ethan: interesting stuff
4/20/22, 17:44 - bad: they just watch some complicayed vids and memorise the thinfs
4/20/22, 17:44 - bad: and think rhey pro
4/20/22, 17:44 - Ethan: lol yea
4/20/22, 17:44 - Ethan: ctrl c ctrl v from github or something
4/20/22, 17:44 - bad: ya so need a foundation
4/20/22, 17:44 - Ethan: techniically you can do that
4/20/22, 17:44 - bad: actually spend time to code
4/20/22, 17:44 - bad: u can
4/20/22, 17:44 - Ethan: but it's so boring
4/20/22, 17:44 - Ethan: the simple stuff
4/20/22, 17:44 - bad: u can makw
4/20/22, 17:44 - bad: complicates stuff
4/20/22, 17:44 - bad: with simple code
4/20/22, 17:44 - Ethan: hmmm
4/20/22, 17:44 - bad: its the ideas
4/20/22, 17:44 - bad: thats why
4/20/22, 17:44 - Ethan: like what
4/20/22, 17:45 - bad: mc plugins are nice
4/20/22, 17:45 - Ethan: which language
4/20/22, 17:45 - bad: theyre cool
4/20/22, 17:45 - Ethan: python?
4/20/22, 17:45 - Ethan: i guess they are decent
4/20/22, 17:45 - bad: simple code and u can creare cool interations in a game
4/20/22, 17:45 - bad: it just gotta interest u
4/20/22, 17:45 - Ethan: ye so i dont lose motivation
4/20/22, 17:45 - Ethan: which happens way too frequently
4/20/22, 17:45 - bad: yea
4/20/22, 17:45 - bad: suc
4/20/22, 17:45 - Ethan: how do you not get bored
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: so start with simple proj
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: thag u can finish in like
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: a day
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: then u be proud
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: and continue
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: lol
4/20/22, 17:46 - Ethan: a day is like 24 hours
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: yes
4/20/22, 17:46 - Ethan: which is a lot
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: i mean
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: a day
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: not the entire day coding
4/20/22, 17:46 - bad: a normal day
4/20/22, 17:47 - bad: where u put in 1-2 hra
4/20/22, 17:47 - Ethan: but i easily get distracted by stuff that are more interesting idk why
4/20/22, 17:47 - Ethan: i re3ally dony
4/20/22, 17:47 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 17:47 - bad: what motivates u
4/20/22, 17:47 - bad: money0
4/20/22, 17:47 - bad: ?
4/20/22, 17:47 - Ethan: hal na
4/20/22, 17:47 - bad: rezpect?
4/20/22, 17:47 - bad: fame?
4/20/22, 17:48 - Ethan: i guess activites where i actually learn stuff and it's fun
4/20/22, 17:48 - Ethan: coding can be quitre repetitive
4/20/22, 17:48 - bad: yes
4/20/22, 17:48 - bad: so ppl like to challenege rhemselves
4/20/22, 17:48 - bad: once ina a while
4/20/22, 17:48 - Ethan: hm interesting
4/20/22, 17:48 - bad: .
4/20/22, 17:48 - bad: .
4/20/22, 17:48 - bad: or whayataty
4/20/22, 17:48 - Ethan: no
4/20/22, 17:48 - bad: You deleted this message
4/20/22, 17:48 - Ethan: honestly im not sure
4/20/22, 17:49 - Ethan: knowledge?

4/20/22, 17:49 - bad: very wrong
4/20/22, 17:49 - Ethan: ai waifu
4/20/22, 17:50 - bad: hmm

4/20/22, 17:50 - bad: so uh
4/20/22, 17:50 - bad: do u want to know
4/20/22, 17:50 - Ethan: what
4/20/22, 17:50 - Ethan: yes
4/20/22, 17:50 - bad: um

4/20/22, 17:50 - bad: which removea clothing
4/20/22, 17:50 - bad: :D
4/20/22, 17:50 - bad: and fun fact
4/20/22, 17:50 - Ethan: that doesnt make sense bru
4/20/22, 17:50 - Ethan: do they creater random body parts
4/20/22, 17:50 - bad: restingravwn tested it and it works
4/20/22, 17:50 - Ethan: like how are they differentiated
4/20/22, 17:51 - bad: it generates THE parts
4/20/22, 17:51 - Ethan: so it's random
4/20/22, 17:51 - bad: no
4/20/22, 17:51 - bad: its deterministic
4/20/22, 17:51 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 17:51 - Ethan: by what lmao
4/20/22, 17:51 - Ethan: how can they tell
4/20/22, 17:51 - bad: the inage
4/20/22, 17:51 - bad: ai
4/20/22, 17:51 - Ethan: from the face?
4/20/22, 17:51 - Ethan: from the arms?
4/20/22, 17:51 - bad: no
4/20/22, 17:51 - bad: the parts
4/20/22, 17:51 - Ethan: from the proportions?
4/20/22, 17:51 - bad: .
4/20/22, 17:51 - Ethan: yes i know but how do they produce the body parts
4/20/22, 17:52 - bad: from its data
4/20/22, 17:52 - Ethan: like what's the factor affecting the procerss
4/20/22, 17:52 - bad: which it learned
4/20/22, 17:52 - bad: obv the data and image
4/20/22, 17:52 - Ethan: yes but WHICH part of the image
4/20/22, 17:52 - Ethan: and how can they draw a pattern
4/20/22, 17:54 - bad: https://github.com/zhengyima/DeepNude_NoWatermark_withModel
4/20/22, 17:54 - Ethan: The networks have been trained to work out where clothes are in an image, mask them by matching skin tone, lighting and shadows and then fill in estimated physical features.
4/20/22, 17:54 - Ethan: this the answer
4/20/22, 17:54 - Ethan: bre
4/20/22, 17:54 - bad: rwad this
4/20/22, 17:55 - Ethan: does this even explain how it works
4/20/22, 17:55 - Ethan: i dont exactly understand code
4/20/22, 17:56 - bad: there is expalantion
4/20/22, 17:57 - bad: ok abywaysy
4/20/22, 17:57 - Ethan: uh is it readme
4/20/22, 17:57 - Ethan: wher
4/20/22, 17:57 - bad: this is not vewy appwopwiate
4/20/22, 17:57 - Ethan: ok
4/20/22, 17:57 - bad: so what to dodidodood
4/20/22, 17:57 - Ethan: idk help me think
4/20/22, 17:58 - Ethan: most preferably intellectual stuff in the sense that i gain information
4/20/22, 17:58 - bad: are u pwo pyschologist
4/20/22, 17:58 - Ethan: or at least im playing with information
4/20/22, 17:58 - bad: ohohohhh
4/20/22, 17:58 - bad: data scientist
4/20/22, 17:58 - Ethan: eh im like 38 percent
4/20/22, 17:58 - Ethan: in the typology field
4/20/22, 17:58 - bad: thats not fun
4/20/22, 17:58 - bad: wat that
4/20/22, 17:58 - Ethan: in psychology itself probably 4 percent
4/20/22, 17:58 - Ethan: hmm
4/20/22, 17:59 - bad: i was forced to attenx the sabbat
4/20/22, 17:59 - Ethan: im asking for projects not careers
4/20/22, 17:59 - bad: and it was boring af
4/20/22, 17:59 - Ethan: L
4/20/22, 17:59 - bad: ya data science proj
4/20/22, 17:59 - bad: analyze shit
4/20/22, 17:59 - bad: play with numbers
4/20/22, 17:59 - bad: math
4/20/22, 17:59 - Ethan: seems interesting
4/20/22, 17:59 - Ethan: but a tad granular
4/20/22, 17:59 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 17:59 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 17:59 - Ethan: actually not a tad
4/20/22, 17:59 - bad: vreg
4/20/22, 17:59 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:00 - bad: how do ppl find this interesting
4/20/22, 18:00 - bad: brehhh
4/20/22, 18:00 - Ethan: lol
4/20/22, 18:00 - Ethan: math people
4/20/22, 18:00 - bad: nerddddddd
4/20/22, 18:00 - bad: :)
4/20/22, 18:00 - Ethan: so any other projects
4/20/22, 18:00 - bad: idk
4/20/22, 18:00 - bad: if u do data scieence
4/20/22, 18:00 - bad: u gotta
4/20/22, 18:00 - bad: python
4/20/22, 18:00 - bad: and R
4/20/22, 18:00 - Ethan: what's r
4/20/22, 18:01 - bad: data zcience
4/20/22, 18:01 - bad: lang
4/20/22, 18:01 - bad: and its TERRIBLE
4/20/22, 18:01 - Ethan: bre
4/20/22, 18:01 - Ethan: another language
4/20/22, 18:01 - bad: I HATE IT
4/20/22, 18:01 - Ethan: oh does it use external factors
4/20/22, 18:01 - Ethan: like data modelling
4/20/22, 18:01 - bad: graph?
4/20/22, 18:01 - Ethan: ya
4/20/22, 18:01 - bad: yes no shot
4/20/22, 18:01 - Ethan: so like time or stuff like that
4/20/22, 18:01 - bad: u can plot anything
4/20/22, 18:01 - Ethan: or growth rate of economy or some other esoteric stuff
4/20/22, 18:02 - bad: lemme send u some clash royale data scientist guy done
4/20/22, 18:02 - bad: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/gc2ouv/effort_post_ladder_matchmaking_data_analytics_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
4/20/22, 18:02 - bad: VERY LOBG
4/20/22, 18:02 - bad: BEWARE
4/20/22, 18:02 - bad: U MIGHT DIE FROM READING
4/20/22, 18:02 - Ethan: esswentially pattern recognition
4/20/22, 18:03 - bad: tons of stuff
4/20/22, 18:04 - bad: basically analayze
4/20/22, 18:04 - Ethan: wait
4/20/22, 18:04 - Ethan: this doesnt really make sense
4/20/22, 18:04 - bad: what
4/20/22, 18:04 - bad: stop not maing sense
4/20/22, 18:04 - Ethan: how does the card played currently affect the card played in the next gam,e
4/20/22, 18:04 - Ethan: is this what data scientists do
4/20/22, 18:04 - bad: idk
4/20/22, 18:04 - bad: i didnt reax the whole thing
4/20/22, 18:04 - bad: where jsit
4/20/22, 18:05 - Ethan: draw random connections and neatly arrange them in a post
4/20/22, 18:05 - bad: breh it says it doesnt
4/20/22, 18:05 - Ethan: wait they are an engineer
4/20/22, 18:05 - Ethan: exactly
4/20/22, 18:05 - bad: <Media omitted>
4/20/22, 18:05 - Ethan: so
4/20/22, 18:05 - Ethan: bre read the crux of the post
4/20/22, 18:06 - bad: wait
4/20/22, 18:06 - bad: its not this one
4/20/22, 18:06 - bad: ooooooops
4/20/22, 18:06 - Ethan: breeeee

4/20/22, 18:07 - bad: u shld reas the wjole thing
4/20/22, 18:07 - bad: its not bad
4/20/22, 18:08 - bad: anddd ill be back in like 20m
4/20/22, 18:08 - bad: u shld prob tske that long
4/20/22, 18:12 - Ethan: Skill represents the skill of a player. When 2 players have : equal levels, then I use this eqn to find out who wins a match: Chance of more skilled player winning = 0.5 * skill difference/2.5
4/20/22, 18:12 - Ethan: huh
4/20/22, 18:12 - Ethan: isnt it 0
4/20/22, 18:15 - Ethan: these data are actually useful to the game
4/20/22, 18:16 - Ethan: for example they can cap the players' league based on their highest level cards in order to reduce the entropy and establish an equilibrium
4/20/22, 18:16 - Ethan: im done reading
4/20/22, 18:17 - Ethan: and vice versa actually for less skilled but consistent players
4/20/22, 18:18 - bad: ok
4/20/22, 18:18 - Ethan: but what this means is that skill isnt an advantage anoymore
4/20/22, 18:18 - bad: nice
4/20/22, 18:18 - bad: ues
4/20/22, 18:18 - Ethan: it's very stable
4/20/22, 18:18 - bad: yes
4/20/22, 18:18 - Ethan: ok nice good read
4/20/22, 18:18 - bad: so
4/20/22, 18:18 - Ethan: what now
4/20/22, 18:18 - bad: are u going to be data sciencis
4/20/22, 18:19 - Ethan: maybe
4/20/22, 18:19 - Ethan: im not familiar enough with the subject lol
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: yes
4/20/22, 18:19 - Ethan: im not even completely sure what they do
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: it.feels like
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: data.science
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: is harder than coding
4/20/22, 18:19 - Ethan: datamining
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: for me at leasy
4/20/22, 18:19 - Ethan: basically
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: thats part of data science
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: u need to web scrap
4/20/22, 18:19 - Ethan: datamining but manual
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:19 - Ethan: so anything else
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: no manual
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:19 - bad: its all automatic
4/20/22, 18:20 - Ethan: it's literally their job
4/20/22, 18:20 - bad: to code the thing
4/20/22, 18:20 - Ethan: im talking about their job
4/20/22, 18:20 - bad: to web scrap
4/20/22, 18:20 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:20 - Ethan: bre
4/20/22, 18:20 - Ethan: bre
4/20/22, 18:20 - bad: brwh
4/20/22, 18:20 - bad: theu dont type
4/20/22, 18:20 - bad: the data
4/20/22, 18:20 - Ethan: mining?
4/20/22, 18:20 - bad: with a program theh made
4/20/22, 18:20 - Ethan: data doesnt have to relate to code
4/20/22, 18:20 - Ethan: it can be any form of information
4/20/22, 18:20 - bad: IT IS HOW THEY DO IT
4/20/22, 18:20 - bad: theu get data
4/20/22, 18:21 - Ethan: i know but they have to determine the pattern first
4/20/22, 18:21 - Ethan: lol
4/20/22, 18:21 - bad: yes
4/20/22, 18:21 - bad: ofc
4/20/22, 18:21 - Ethan: ya so it's kind of manual
4/20/22, 18:21 - bad: but data mining itself
4/20/22, 18:21 - bad: isnt manual
4/20/22, 18:21 - Ethan: bre i know
4/20/22, 18:21 - Ethan: hence the "manual"
4/20/22, 18:21 - bad: brwh
4/20/22, 18:21 - bad: well.for starters
4/20/22, 18:21 - Ethan: if datamining is manual then what's the point of saying manual datamining
4/20/22, 18:21 - bad: download data
4/20/22, 18:21 - Ethan: what
4/20/22, 18:21 - Ethan: what data
4/20/22, 18:21 - bad: any data
4/20/22, 18:22 - Ethan: heh?
4/20/22, 18:22 - bad: in the sabbat
4/20/22, 18:22 - bad: i think
4/20/22, 18:22 - Ethan: oh
4/20/22, 18:22 - bad: we used some singaporw
4/20/22, 18:22 - Ethan: ok then
4/20/22, 18:22 - bad: hdb
4/20/22, 18:22 - bad: price
4/20/22, 18:22 - bad: rhingy
4/20/22, 18:22 - Ethan: and then
4/20/22, 18:22 - Ethan: what do you do next
4/20/22, 18:22 - bad: so.
4/20/22, 18:22 - bad: u have to.learn r
4/20/22, 18:23 - Ethan: ok
4/20/22, 18:23 - bad: which sucks
4/20/22, 18:23 - bad: because
4/20/22, 18:23 - bad: its all funcional proframming
4/20/22, 18:23 - bad: so
4/20/22, 18:23 - bad: u have to memorise all the methods
4/20/22, 18:23 - bad: but that means
4/20/22, 18:23 - bad: theres less logic
4/20/22, 18:23 - Ethan: see that's what i dont like about coding
4/20/22, 18:23 - Ethan: it's really esoteric
4/20/22, 18:23 - bad: whay
4/20/22, 18:23 - bad: that mean
4/20/22, 18:24 - Ethan: uh it means only a small group of people have that info
4/20/22, 18:24 - bad: what
4/20/22, 18:24 - Ethan: and only when you have it can you proceed
4/20/22, 18:24 - bad: why do u sy that
4/20/22, 18:24 - Ethan: it's not intuitive
4/20/22, 18:24 - bad: wdym
4/20/22, 18:24 - bad: u can learn it
4/20/22, 18:24 - Ethan: yes
4/20/22, 18:24 - bad: then wat ths
4/20/22, 18:24 - Ethan: it means only people in that field know about it
4/20/22, 18:25 - bad: um
4/20/22, 18:25 - Ethan: so it requires more rote memorisation instead of common sense or intuition
4/20/22, 18:25 - bad: isnt most stuff like that
4/20/22, 18:25 - bad: like doctor
4/20/22, 18:25 - Ethan: ya but this is more technical
4/20/22, 18:25 - bad: what
4/20/22, 18:25 - bad: most people know how it works and all
4/20/22, 18:25 - Ethan: for doctors at east there's a link to your physical body
4/20/22, 18:26 - Ethan: there's a connection you see
4/20/22, 18:26 - bad: and code is everywhere
4/20/22, 18:26 - bad: u are using a piece of software rn
4/20/22, 18:26 - Ethan: bre that's different
4/20/22, 18:26 - Ethan: using the code and writing it is two different sides of the coin
4/20/22, 18:26 - Ethan: are
4/20/22, 18:26 - bad: ofc
4/20/22, 18:26 - bad: if not how will people get jobs
4/20/22, 18:27 - bad: if everyone knows how to do it
4/20/22, 18:27 - bad: every career has a technicaly aspect to it
4/20/22, 18:27 - Ethan: yes all jobs require such a learinng process to a certain extent
4/20/22, 18:27 - Ethan: some require more
4/20/22, 18:27 - bad: yes
4/20/22, 18:27 - Ethan: some less
4/20/22, 18:27 - Ethan: take philosophy as an exampe
4/20/22, 18:27 - bad: the ones that require more are therefore paid higher
4/20/22, 18:27 - Ethan: it's centered around the concept of thinking and application of logic to arrive at a conclusion
4/20/22, 18:28 - Ethan: not necessarily
4/20/22, 18:28 - bad: usually
4/20/22, 18:28 - bad: its true
4/20/22, 18:28 - bad: it takes more skill
4/20/22, 18:28 - Ethan: actors?
4/20/22, 18:28 - Ethan: vs data scientists
4/20/22, 18:28 - bad: acting takes skill
4/20/22, 18:28 - Ethan: less
4/20/22, 18:28 - bad: to a certain extent
4/20/22, 18:28 - bad: so i said usally
4/20/22, 18:28 - Ethan: way less hard core memorisation
4/20/22, 18:28 - Ethan: and more intuition
4/20/22, 18:28 - bad: the entertainment industry is weird
4/20/22, 18:28 - Ethan: yes so do you see the dichotomy
4/20/22, 18:28 - Ethan: both sides allow for financial benefits
4/20/22, 18:28 - bad: are u saying ur gonna be an actor
4/20/22, 18:28 - bad: lol
4/20/22, 18:29 - Ethan: hal na
4/20/22, 18:29 - Ethan: not that extreme
4/20/22, 18:29 - bad: thats what cheng is doing
4/20/22, 18:29 - bad: he becoming pro youtuber
4/20/22, 18:29 - bad: :D
4/20/22, 18:29 - Ethan: bre
4/20/22, 18:29 - bad: and today
4/20/22, 18:29 - Ethan: yea that also takes less memorisational skills
4/20/22, 18:29 - bad: he spent 2 hours during lessons
4/20/22, 18:29 - bad: making a wallpaper for his pc
4/20/22, 18:29 - Ethan: what
4/20/22, 18:29 - Ethan: how
4/20/22, 18:29 - bad: 🤦‍♂️
4/20/22, 18:29 - Ethan: wait what
4/20/22, 18:29 - Ethan: HOW
4/20/22, 18:29 - bad: waste of time
4/20/22, 18:29 - bad: what
4/20/22, 18:30 - Ethan: browsing or what
4/20/22, 18:30 - bad: he just combined some pics
4/20/22, 18:30 - Ethan: and which lesson lasts for 2 hours
4/20/22, 18:30 - bad: he used 2 lessons
4/20/22, 18:30 - bad: LOL
4/20/22, 18:30 - Ethan: bre nice
4/20/22, 18:30 - Ethan: nice
4/20/22, 18:30 - bad: yes
4/20/22, 18:30 - bad: intelligence
4/20/22, 18:30 - bad: lemme ask him to send it
4/20/22, 18:30 - bad: anyways
4/20/22, 18:31 - bad: DO WHAT
4/20/22, 18:31 - bad: ahahhhahehrhera
4/20/22, 18:31 - Ethan: ive tried engineering
4/20/22, 18:31 - Ethan: very physical
4/20/22, 18:31 - bad: um
4/20/22, 18:31 - bad: ofc
4/20/22, 18:31 - bad: lol
4/20/22, 18:31 - bad: software engineer :D
4/20/22, 18:31 - bad: aka coding
4/20/22, 18:31 - bad: :DDD
4/20/22, 18:31 - Ethan: bre
4/20/22, 18:32 - bad: see
4/20/22, 18:32 - Ethan: or computer science
4/20/22, 18:32 - bad: its so much better
4/20/22, 18:32 - bad: coding is nice
4/20/22, 18:32 - Ethan: hm
4/20/22, 18:32 - bad: everything comes at a cost
4/20/22, 18:33 - Ethan: bre physicians actually make a lot of money
4/20/22, 18:33 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:33 - Ethan: wait how
4/20/22, 18:33 - Ethan: 240k
4/20/22, 18:33 - bad: thats even harder
4/20/22, 18:33 - bad: how tf would i know
4/20/22, 18:33 - bad: phyics succc
4/20/22, 18:33 - Ethan: do you know what physicans do
4/20/22, 18:33 - Ethan: breee'=
4/20/22, 18:33 - bad: no
4/20/22, 18:33 - Ethan: dude
4/20/22, 18:33 - bad: they perform physic
4/20/22, 18:33 - bad: :)
4/20/22, 18:33 - Ethan: it's different from physicist
4/20/22, 18:33 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:33 - Ethan: lol
4/20/22, 18:33 - Ethan: hysicians are healthcare professionals who help diagnose and treat patients. They can work as a general primary care physician or specialize in a certain area, such as cancer or bone treatment. Doctors provide preventative healthcare advice to their patients and may coordinate with other specialists depending on individual diagnoses. Doctors employ many skills when performing their duties, including effective communication, problem-solving, decision-making and professionalism. Because doctors work with complex situations involving people, this can be intellectually stimulating.
4/20/22, 18:33 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: so basically doctors
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:34 - Ethan: yes
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: thats kinda dumb
4/20/22, 18:34 - Ethan: ?
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: anyways
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: are u gonna be physician
4/20/22, 18:34 - Ethan: no
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: ok
4/20/22, 18:34 - Ethan: biology
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: good  to hear
4/20/22, 18:34 - Ethan: lol
4/20/22, 18:34 - bad: what u gonna do with bio
4/20/22, 18:35 - bad: make covid 2.0
4/20/22, 18:35 - Ethan: dissect thyself
4/20/22, 18:35 - bad: er
4/20/22, 18:35 - bad: nice
4/20/22, 18:35 - bad: u know
4/20/22, 18:35 - bad: coding is actually nice because it can be implemented so many diffent areas
4/20/22, 18:35 - Ethan: hm no
4/20/22, 18:35 - Ethan: hm
4/20/22, 18:35 - bad: u can put coding and bio tgt
4/20/22, 18:35 - bad: and make some microchip
4/20/22, 18:35 - Ethan: ye it sure is an expanding industry
4/20/22, 18:35 - bad: which is what elon is diong
4/20/22, 18:35 - Ethan: actually it's not exactly an industry
4/20/22, 18:36 - bad: its part of tech
4/20/22, 18:36 - Ethan: ye just 100x bigger
4/20/22, 18:36 - Ethan: literally goes to space
4/20/22, 18:36 - bad: what
4/20/22, 18:36 - bad: he gonna make micro chip
4/20/22, 18:36 - Ethan: literally rocket science
4/20/22, 18:36 - bad: and put it in ur brain
4/20/22, 18:36 - Ethan: yes
4/20/22, 18:36 - Ethan: music
4/20/22, 18:36 - bad: rickroll

4/20/22, 18:36 - bad: can u vc
4/20/22, 18:37 - bad: i want to code some stuff
4/20/22, 18:37 - bad: and i shall not type
4/20/22, 18:37 - Ethan: why do you need me
4/20/22, 18:37 - Ethan: what

4/20/22, 22:17 - bad: i dont feel like it
4/20/22, 22:17 - bad: also i need finish coding someting :)
4/20/22, 22:17 - Ethan: uh ok
4/20/22, 22:17 - bad: heheheha
4/20/22, 22:21 - Ethan: do you know about ctf
4/20/22, 22:22 - bad: er
4/20/22, 22:22 - bad: capture the flag
4/20/22, 22:23 - Ethan: the coding one
4/20/22, 22:23 - bad: no
4/20/22, 22:23 - Ethan: search
4/20/22, 22:23 - Ethan: interestiing stuff
4/20/22, 22:23 - bad: so
4/20/22, 22:23 - bad: hack
4/20/22, 22:24 - Ethan: not really
4/20/22, 22:24 - Ethan: just the detecting part
4/20/22, 22:24 - bad: so
4/20/22, 22:24 - bad: cybersecurity
4/20/22, 22:24 - Ethan: yep
4/20/22, 22:24 - Ethan: seems interesting
4/20/22, 22:24 - bad: er
4/20/22, 22:24 - bad: r u gonna be hacker
4/20/22, 22:25 - bad: hacker detector
4/20/22, 22:25 - Ethan: what
4/20/22, 22:25 - bad: white hat hacker
4/20/22, 22:25 - bad: idk
4/20/22, 22:25 - Ethan: yes
4/20/22, 22:25 - bad: hmm
4/20/22, 22:25 - Ethan: good people :D
4/20/22, 22:25 - bad: thats way harder than coding
4/20/22, 22:25 - bad: im pretty sure
4/20/22, 22:25 - bad: lol
4/20/22, 22:25 - Ethan: it is codi9ng
4/20/22, 22:25 - bad: but harder
4/20/22, 22:26 - bad: because u need to learn security
4/20/22, 22:26 - bad: :)
4/20/22, 22:26 - Ethan: INTERESTING
4/20/22, 22:26 - Ethan: VERY INTERESTING
4/20/22, 22:26 - bad: er
4/20/22, 22:26 - bad: calm down
4/20/22, 22:26 - bad: its just some security
4/20/22, 22:26 - bad: virtual secuiry guard

4/20/22, 22:28 - bad: breh
4/20/22, 22:28 - bad: u realise to learn hacking u need to master coding first right
4/20/22, 22:28 - Ethan: well yes
4/20/22, 22:28 - Ethan: now i have motivation
4/20/22, 22:28 - bad: um so

4/20/22, 22:29 - Ethan: js
4/20/22, 22:29 - bad: wtf does html help u with hacking
4/20/22, 22:29 - Ethan: these two
4/20/22, 22:29 - Ethan: no bre just to understnd it beter
4/20/22, 22:29 - bad: wat

4. Identifying and expressing your uniqueness
5. Gaining knowledge / wisdom /information
6. Security
7. Fun and exciting activities

4/21/22, 22:13 - bad: WHY IS THERE NO MONEY
4/21/22, 22:14 - Ethan: Bre that is very specific
4/21/22, 22:14 - Ethan: It's not a psychological concept
4/21/22, 22:14 - Ethan: Do you put up an image; as in possibly fake success or competence
4/21/22, 22:15 - Ethan: Or do you focus more on actually impacting your environment and being relevant
4/21/22, 22:15 - Ethan: Or rather the obtaining of truth and knowledge
4/21/22, 22:15 - bad: er
4/21/22, 22:15 - bad: can i say all
4/21/22, 22:15 - bad: :D

4/21/22, 22:15 - Ethan: Applies the most to you
4/21/22, 22:15 - bad: hmm
4/21/22, 22:15 - bad: 1 or 2
4/21/22, 22:15 - Ethan: Here?
4/21/22, 22:15 - bad: this
4/21/22, 22:16 - bad: this
4/21/22, 22:16 - Ethan: I see
4/21/22, 22:16 - Ethan: Interesting
4/21/22, 22:16 - Ethan: 3 vs 8
4/21/22, 22:16 - bad: what
4/21/22, 22:16 - Ethan: Hm give me a minute
4/21/22, 22:16 - bad: ok
4/21/22, 22:17 - Ethan: In general terms, both Eights and Threes are ambitious and competitive: both types want to rise above others. The difference is that average Eights are self-assertive and want others to give them their way immediately so they do not have to waste time and energy fighting with people–not that they are afraid to do so. Eights compete for material and sexual dominance, less over purely social or status issues. For instance, Eights usually do not spend a lot of time comparing themselves with others, and certainly never to the degree that Threes do. For the same reason that Threes confuse themselves with Sevens and Fives (because they are looking for a flattering identity), it is far more likely that Threes identify themselves as Eights rather than vice versa.

Despite some superficial similarities, the differences are profound: Eights are leaders, deal makers, and power brokers who want to make the world conform to their personal vision. They want to have a large impact, to build and accomplish great things, possibly something that will live as a testament to the greatness of their audacity and will. Strong and implacable, they can be ruthless when something or someone gets in their way. They have large egos, and achieving some form of glory is important to them. Money is both a form of power and a means to amass more of it. Achieving personal power is the dominating drive in Eights, and there is nothing ambiguous, much less furtive or duplicitous, about them.

By contrast, power is not the key motive of Threes; achieving success and prestige and basking in the admiring attention of others is. (By contrast, Eights do not care about popularity; they do not care about the goodwill of others, so long as they get their way.) If Eights are natural leaders, Threes are natural managers and technicians. If Eights do not fear failure as such, Threes fear failure deeply because they see it as a personal humiliation, a potential occasion for being rejected, their deepest fear. By contrast, Eights see failure as an opportunity to learn something and come back stronger. If Eights are too busy achieving their purposes to worry about public opinion, Threes live and die on the opinions of others and desperately want to be in demand socially. If average Eights are combative and intimidating and can "take the heat", despite a certain bravado, average Threes will back down or be driven to deviousness: they cannot take pressure for long or exposure for a moment. In short, even average Eights are the "genuine article," whereas average Threes are an imitation of it. Contrast Eights such as Telly Savalas and John Wayne with Threes such as Sylvester Stallone and Burt Reynolds.
4/21/22, 22:17 - bad: wtf is EIGHTS
4/21/22, 22:17 - bad: and THREES
4/21/22, 22:17 - bad: ooh sexual dominance
4/21/22, 22:18 - Ethan: So do you relate to three more or to eight
4/21/22, 22:19 - Ethan: Take your time to digest the information; there is a distinct difference between the two
4/21/22, 22:19 - bad: er
4/21/22, 22:19 - bad: er
4/21/22, 22:19 - bad: i do both sometimes

4/21/22, 22:20 - bad: SUCCESS
4/21/22, 22:21 - Ethan: Bre
4/21/22, 22:21 - Ethan: Seems kind of like an 8
4/21/22, 22:21 - Ethan: Do you want control but not necessarily respect and admiration or respect and admiration
4/21/22, 22:21 - Ethan: Pick between the two
4/21/22, 22:21 - Ethan: You HAVE to
4/21/22, 22:21 - bad: maybe respect
4/21/22, 22:21 - bad: :)
4/21/22, 22:21 - Ethan: I see gotcha

4/22/22, 07:05 - bad: i mean caesa
4/22/22, 07:05 - Ethan: For 3s it's more about creating an image
4/22/22, 07:05 - bad: why is he in three
4/22/22, 07:06 - Ethan: So this could be powerful or intelligent or kind or something
4/22/22, 07:06 - bad: hmm
4/22/22, 07:06 - Ethan: The emphasis is on the image, what the image Depicts depends on the individual
4/22/22, 07:06 - bad: ok
4/22/22, 07:07 - bad: SO I WILL BECOME CAEAAR

4/22/22, 14:04 - Ethan: Ah I see okay
4/22/22, 14:04 - bad: succc
4/22/22, 14:04 - Ethan: Okay I'm quite new to this
4/22/22, 14:04 - Ethan: I did kind of expect yours
4/22/22, 14:04 - Ethan: Lol
4/22/22, 14:04 - Ethan: <Media omitted>
4/22/22, 14:05 - bad: YAA
4/22/22, 14:05 - bad: its kinda obvious
4/22/22, 14:05 - Ethan: Actuall
4/22/22, 14:05 - bad: from my status
4/22/22, 14:05 - bad: :)
4/22/22, 14:05 - bad: flex
4/22/22, 14:05 - Ethan: I thought you could be knowledge based
4/22/22, 14:05 - Ethan: Which is 5
4/22/22, 14:05 - Ethan: Idk
4/22/22, 14:05 - bad: hmm
4/22/22, 14:05 - Ethan: Do you kind of like knowledge
4/22/22, 14:05 - Ethan: I think I'm 5 I've read a bit just nkw
4/22/22, 14:05 - bad: NO, MOMEY
4/22/22, 14:06 - bad: MONEU
4/22/22, 14:06 - Ethan: Okay that clears things up

4/22/22, 18:14 - Ethan: <Media omitted>
4/22/22, 18:34 - bad: heheheha
4/22/22, 18:34 - Ethan: Do you relate to this
4/22/22, 18:34 - bad: naybe
4/22/22, 18:35 - Ethan: Bre what
4/22/22, 18:35 - Ethan: Obviously maybe
4/22/22, 18:35 - bad: maybe
4/22/22, 18:35 - bad: maybe
4/22/22, 18:35 - Ethan: Most things maybe trye
4/22/22, 18:35 - Ethan: 99% of things may be true
4/22/22, 18:36 - Ethan: OK based on your speech pattern I'm going to assume you mean yes
4/22/22, 18:36 - Ethan: Jn which case it makes a lot of sense
4/22/22, 18:36 - Ethan: The more I research the more it makes sense
4/22/22, 18:36 - Ethan: The discord server
4/22/22, 18:36 - Ethan: The mc server
4/22/22, 18:36 - Ethan: Everything
4/22/22, 18:36 - bad: YAAAA
4/22/22, 18:36 - bad: SEE
4/22/22, 18:37 - Ethan: You desire respect, fame and financial value
4/22/22, 18:38 - bad: YES
4/22/22, 18:44 - Ethan: OK here are steorotypes
4/22/22, 18:44 - Ethan: Enneagram Threes
The stereotype of the Enneagram Three is the person in the sharp suit, making deals, driving shiny cars and regularly earning promotions and pay rises. They are comfortable delivering a performance to a few or many, and are seen as lacking empathy in their drive for success.

In stark contrast, the Self-Preservation Three is humble, modest and driven to be a good person. They don’t wear designer label clothes, and they might have a nice car but feel embarrassed to be seen driving it. They can still be workaholics, but as opposed to being seen as successful they want to be seen as being good.

They can be mistaken for Ones.
4/22/22, 18:45 - bad: i dont have a shiny car
4/22/22, 18:45 - bad: :(
4/22/22, 18:45 - Ethan: Don't mind me i might just keep dumping information on you
4/22/22, 18:46 - Ethan: Bre in the future
4/22/22, 18:46 - Ethan: This might not apply as it's referring to working adults
4/22/22, 18:46 - bad: pls dont
4/22/22, 18:46 - Ethan: Hm
4/22/22, 18:46 - bad: i want shiny car
4/22/22, 18:48 - Ethan: I think I might be a 6
4/22/22, 18:49 - Ethan: 5
4/22/22, 18:49 - Ethan: A few thoughts on average 5 speaking traits:

Logical
technically correct
emotionally neutral words
Talk less than more, except maybe when speaking to their expertise area
Not like "small talk”
more formal tone
honest and clear what don’t know
may use wit, but not story telling/jokes
good analogies and descriptive language
talk slower vs. faster
less eye contact
accurate and clear adjectives and language
limited to no hand gestures
limited body movement or walking around while speaking
4/22/22, 18:49 - bad: hmm

How do other see Type 5’s?
I thought it’ll be interesting to know the common characteristics of the type 5’s. I noticed recently that I tend to put on “masks” to blend in the crowd or to make an impression depending on the environments atmosphere. I also wondered of what our speaking style, body language and similarities of our appearance!

Anything will do!

UPDATE: What about the clothes we usually wear?

I would agree with the observation of the "masks" but it seems like less of a manipulative thing, and more of a survival hack in social settings.

Speaking style is romantic and filled with analogies, which is always creative and fun.

The more insecure 5's i've known always lead with a disclaimer and seem to apologize frequently.

Very reserved body movements, especially with physical touch. All the 5's I have known do not tend to initiate it, will not detest any touching, but don't seek it out or seem to get much out of it unless they know how the other person is experiencing it. Like a hug or a back pat, etc.

Very very compassionate and willing to sit for hours and hours with anyone.

Very excited and encouraging about any topic of discussion, and very resilient in relationship.

There isn't a lot of expected upkeep or communication which makes it all the easier to pursue close friendship without expectation
4/22/22, 18:49 - bad: seems to fit
4/22/22, 18:49 - bad: imagine no money
4/22/22, 18:49 - Ethan: 3 vs 5
4/22/22, 18:49 - Ethan: 3w4 here! I love 5s!!! Here’s a few reasons why: 1) I get along well with 5s because we both want to be experts in our area. Generally I work really well with them because we value efficiency and competency. I am frequently attracted to/impressed by 5s because they are always so good at everything they do! 2) like others said, 5s don’t speak very much and are sometimes a bit more closed off. This often makes them seem mysterious and therefore super attractive. I currently have a crush on a 5 because of this. 3) unlike me (a 3), 5s don’t care about their image and whether they are socially acceptable. The 5s in my life refuse to engage in small talk because they think it’s a waste of time - which sometimes makes them seem cold and hard to connect with. But sometimes this is helpful for me to be around - 5s remind me not to care as much about what people think about me! 4) fives. Are. So. Slow. At least compared to me, a fast-paced 3. They have one, slow speed, and they never change it. They tend to think for a long time before they speak and approach problems in a slow, patient, methodical way. But that is so helpful for me to be around because it reminds me to slow down in life. 5) 5s are super quirky! They have really fascinating, niche hobbies 6) I can always count on us having an intellectually stimulating conversation
4/22/22, 18:50 - Ethan: Bre idk why but I really don't care
4/22/22, 18:51 - bad: seem myserious and there ade super attravtive
4/22/22, 18:51 - bad: er
4/22/22, 18:51 - bad: er
4/22/22, 18:51 - bad: er
4/22/22, 18:51 - bad: er
4/22/22, 18:51 - bad: er
4/22/22, 18:51 - Ethan: I hope I don't decelope an unhealthy obsession with thus
4/22/22, 18:51 - Ethan: Uh
4/22/22, 18:51 - bad: hmmmm
4/22/22, 18:51 - Ethan: Not all steorotypes apply
4/22/22, 18:51 - Ethan: :)
4/22/22, 18:51 - bad: 'i currently have a crsuh on 5'
4/22/22, 18:51 - bad: hmmmmmmmm
4/22/22, 18:52 - Ethan: Bre what ignore that
4/22/22, 18:52 - Ethan: Try to see the diff
4/22/22, 18:52 - Ethan: That's what the diff is between you and me
4/22/22, 18:52 - Ethan: :)
4/22/22, 18:52 - bad: no
4/22/22, 18:52 - bad: nice
4/22/22, 18:52 - bad: need diff
4/22/22, 18:52 - bad: complement each other
4/22/22, 18:53 - Ethan: That's true
4/22/22, 20:54 - Ethan: Do you know diary of a wimpy kid
4/22/22, 20:57 - bad: isnt that like in pri sch
4/22/22, 20:57 - bad: i never read it
4/22/22, 21:00 - Ethan: oh ok nvm then
4/23/22, 11:48 - bad: <Media omitted>
4/23/22, 11:49 - Ethan: what why
4/23/22, 11:50 - Ethan: bre i dont understand this shit
4/23/22, 11:50 - bad: breh
4/23/22, 11:50 - bad: first: its a util class
4/23/22, 11:50 - Ethan: ok
4/23/22, 11:50 - bad: second: the configs hashmap being static makes the data sync across all instances of the class
4/23/22, 11:51 - bad: so u can call a FileUtils.getConfig() here and anothet FileUtils.reloadConfig() somewhere else
4/23/22, 11:51 - bad: and the config will still be stored in configs
4/23/22, 11:51 - Ethan: oh i think i gwt it
4/23/22, 11:51 - Ethan: oh
4/23/22, 11:51 - bad: yes
4/23/22, 11:52 - bad: this when static is useful :D
4/23/22, 11:52 - Ethan: hm ok
4/23/22, 11:52 - Ethan: wait doesnt static already do this
4/23/22, 11:53 - bad: yea thats the poiny
4/23/22, 11:53 - bad: thats why i put static there
4/23/22, 11:53 - Ethan: hm
4/23/22, 11:53 - Ethan: bre so what's wrong with using static normally
4/23/22, 11:53 - Ethan: isnt it good
4/23/22, 11:53 - bad: nooo
4/23/22, 11:53 - bad: static abuse
4/23/22, 11:53 - bad: is bad
4/23/22, 11:54 - bad: lots of security issues and stuff
4/23/22, 11:54 - Ethan: security?
4/23/22, 11:54 - Ethan: how
4/23/22, 11:54 - bad: changing something changes everything across all instances of the class
4/23/22, 11:54 - bad: and code might break
4/23/22, 11:54 - Ethan: yea but the thing is there is often a need for such scenarios
4/23/22, 11:55 - Ethan: for efficiency
4/23/22, 11:55 - bad: efficiency?
4/23/22, 11:55 - Ethan: yes
4/23/22, 11:55 - bad: wat scenario
4/23/22, 11:55 - bad: if.its like that then can
4/23/22, 11:56 - bad: so
4/23/22, 11:57 - Ethan: uh i might have overestimated the need for synced classes
4/23/22, 11:57 - bad: wdym synced classes
4/23/22, 11:57 - Ethan: what
4/23/22, 11:57 - Ethan: arent they synced
4/23/22, 11:57 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 11:57 - bad: wat synced
4/23/22, 11:57 - Ethan: .
4/23/22, 11:57 - bad: oh
4/23/22, 11:58 - bad: its basically global variables
4/23/22, 11:58 - Ethan: ya
4/23/22, 11:58 - Ethan: so
4/23/22, 11:58 - bad: also
4/23/22, 11:58 - bad: static methods cant access non static vars
4/23/22, 12:52 - Ethan: <Media omitted>
4/23/22, 12:58 - bad: er
4/23/22, 12:58 - Ethan: bro the entire chat is filled with cheesy esoteric jokes
4/23/22, 12:58 - Ethan: not that im complaining
4/23/22, 13:05 - bad: wat chat
4/23/22, 13:10 - Ethan: cybersecurity
4/23/22, 13:10 - Ethan: do you get it tho
4/23/22, 13:10 - Ethan: something about user experience vs user interface
4/23/22, 18:28 - Ethan: bre the flex
4/23/22, 18:28 - bad: thats the point
4/23/22, 18:28 - Ethan: lol
4/23/22, 18:28 - bad: but it is high quality
4/23/22, 18:28 - bad: ;)
4/23/22, 18:28 - Ethan: hm that is subjective
4/23/22, 18:28 - Ethan: :)
4/23/22, 18:29 - bad: er
4/23/22, 18:29 - bad: i mean
4/23/22, 18:29 - bad: theres a certain standars
4/23/22, 18:29 - Ethan: it's impossible to objectively be good quality
4/23/22, 18:29 - Ethan: unless tjere's a definition
4/23/22, 18:29 - Ethan: <Media omitted>
4/23/22, 18:29 - bad: to enterpise coding
4/23/22, 18:29 - Ethan: oh is it specific
4/23/22, 18:29 - Ethan: like a check lsit
4/23/22, 18:29 - bad: not really
4/23/22, 18:30 - bad: but generally
4/23/22, 18:30 - Ethan: L then
4/23/22, 18:30 - bad: the code shld be easily expandable, conscise documentation and formatting, readability
4/23/22, 18:30 - bad: and thats not counting the technical part
4/23/22, 18:30 - Ethan: that looks very vulnerable to loop holes
4/23/22, 18:30 - bad: why
4/23/22, 18:31 - Ethan: as in it's easy to fulfill all these with a simple code
4/23/22, 18:31 - bad: um
4/23/22, 18:31 - Ethan: could be a very simple code
4/23/22, 18:31 - Ethan: doesnt mention about complexity
4/23/22, 18:31 - Ethan: :/
4/23/22, 18:31 - bad: yea
4/23/22, 18:31 - Ethan: so
4/23/22, 18:31 - bad: solve it the easiest way possible obv
4/23/22, 18:31 - Ethan: it cou;d literally be, what 5 lines
4/23/22, 18:31 - bad: sure it could
4/23/22, 18:31 - Ethan: lol
4/23/22, 18:32 - bad: but the 5 lines of code of high quality
4/23/22, 18:32 - bad: vs 5 lines of low quality
4/23/22, 18:32 - Ethan: documentation as in comments or what
4/23/22, 18:32 - bad: its part of it
4/23/22, 18:32 - Ethan: you see the term concise here is also not objective
4/23/22, 18:32 - Ethan: neither is readibility
4/23/22, 18:32 - Ethan: neither is formatting
4/23/22, 18:32 - Ethan: :/
4/23/22, 18:32 - bad: there is a certain standard
4/23/22, 18:33 - Ethan: .
4/23/22, 18:33 - bad: what
4/23/22, 18:33 - bad: no breh
4/23/22, 18:33 - Ethan: exactly'
4/23/22, 18:33 - bad: coding is a LANGUAGE
4/23/22, 18:33 - bad: ofc its subjective
4/23/22, 18:33 - Ethan: if you break it down enough
4/23/22, 18:33 - Ethan: it cannot be objecrtuve
4/23/22, 18:33 - Ethan: it cannot be objectively good
4/23/22, 18:33 - Ethan: impossib;le
4/23/22, 18:33 - Ethan: unless you have a specific check list
4/23/22, 18:33 - bad: there is still a standard
4/23/22, 18:33 - Ethan: which is fragile
4/23/22, 18:34 - bad: how do people determine whats good and bad code then
4/23/22, 18:34 - Ethan: that's my point
4/23/22, 18:34 - Ethan: it's subjective
4/23/22, 18:34 - bad: .
4/23/22, 18:34 - bad: the logic however
4/23/22, 18:34 - Ethan: i know but there isnt a distinct line
4/23/22, 18:34 - bad: is not very subjective
4/23/22, 18:34 - Ethan: is there a certain limit to a bad quality code?
4/23/22, 18:34 - Ethan: well technically speaking
4/23/22, 18:34 - bad: wdym limit
4/23/22, 18:34 - bad: it can always get worse
4/23/22, 18:34 - bad: :D
4/23/22, 18:34 - Ethan: logic doesnt have a physica; limit
4/23/22, 18:35 - bad: yes it doesnt
4/23/22, 18:35 - Ethan: untrue
4/23/22, 18:35 - bad: yes it can
4/23/22, 18:35 - Ethan: once it's so bad it's absurd
4/23/22, 18:35 - Ethan: it cannot get worse
4/23/22, 18:35 - bad: add another useless function that slows it down :D
4/23/22, 18:35 - bad: add 2
4/23/22, 18:35 - Ethan: as in it doesnt connect
4/23/22, 18:35 - bad: add 3
4/23/22, 18:35 - bad: lol
4/23/22, 18:35 - Ethan: that's not logic
4/23/22, 18:35 - Ethan: breee
4/23/22, 18:35 - bad: i mean this
4/23/22, 18:35 - bad: theres no limit
4/23/22, 18:35 - Ethan: oh
4/23/22, 18:36 - Ethan: well one can categorise it as the adding of useless cde
4/23/22, 18:36 - bad: yes
4/23/22, 18:36 - bad: which is bad
4/23/22, 18:36 - Ethan: meaning as long as there is a [presence of bad code, it is objectively bad
4/23/22, 18:36 - Ethan: meaning it cannot get worse
4/23/22, 18:36 - Ethan: there isnt a spectrum
4/23/22, 18:36 - bad: people can agree on how good the code logic is
4/23/22, 18:36 - bad: or how bad it is
4/23/22, 18:36 - bad: through like
4/23/22, 18:36 - bad: performance
4/23/22, 18:36 - Ethan: exactly
4/23/22, 18:36 - bad: or something
4/23/22, 18:36 - Ethan: that is my point
4/23/22, 18:36 - bad: ya
4/23/22, 18:37 - bad: so its.not suvjective
4/23/22, 18:37 - Ethan: it cannot be objectively good
4/23/22, 18:37 - Ethan: bre
4/23/22, 18:37 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 18:37 - Ethan: if people can give their opinions
4/23/22, 18:37 - Ethan: that differ and are nuanced
4/23/22, 18:37 - Ethan: then it isnt objective
4/23/22, 18:37 - bad: breh its like a math qn with multiple ways of doing it
4/23/22, 18:37 - Ethan: in order to be objective it has to be either yes or no
4/23/22, 18:37 - Ethan: no exceptions
4/23/22, 18:37 - Ethan: yes but this is different
4/23/22, 18:37 - bad: its rhe same
4/23/22, 18:37 - Ethan: it's a yes no question
4/23/22, 18:37 - bad: what
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: why
4/23/22, 18:38 - Ethan: is it good quality or is it not
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: breh
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: quality is a yes or no
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: breh
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: breh
4/23/22, 18:38 - Ethan: ya
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: theres in betweens
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: not*
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: not
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: oops
4/23/22, 18:38 - Ethan: ya but you youself divded it into extremes
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: i didnt
4/23/22, 18:38 - Ethan: by saying it is good the only other option is it isnt
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: theres many ways of doing it
4/23/22, 18:38 - bad: of different quality
4/23/22, 18:39 - bad: but there will always be one which is the best
4/23/22, 18:39 - Ethan: because no matter if it's very good or a bit good, it's stil good
4/23/22, 18:39 - Ethan: get it?
4/23/22, 18:39 - bad: theres a best
4/23/22, 18:39 - Ethan: bre
4/23/22, 18:39 - bad: its true
4/23/22, 18:39 - Ethan: even it's not the best, it is still good
4/23/22, 18:39 - Ethan: so it's irrelevant
4/23/22, 18:39 - bad: then its not the best
4/23/22, 18:39 - bad: and should be improved
4/23/22, 18:39 - Ethan: yes but you didnt say that it isnt
4/23/22, 18:39 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 18:39 - Ethan: nor did you say that it is the best
4/23/22, 18:40 - bad: say what
4/23/22, 18:40 - Ethan: so being the "best" is irrelevant here
4/23/22, 18:40 - Ethan: the besty
4/23/22, 18:40 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 18:40 - bad: the best is the bset
4/23/22, 18:40 - Ethan: you just labelled it as "good quality"
4/23/22, 18:40 - bad: yes
4/23/22, 18:40 - Ethan: not quite good or slightly good or extremely good
4/23/22, 18:40 - Ethan: all of them fall under "good"
4/23/22, 18:40 - Ethan: so the only other option is
4/23/22, 18:40 - Ethan: "not good quality"
4/23/22, 18:40 - bad: good quality means it is widely regarded as good
4/23/22, 18:41 - Ethan: yes but again it is not relevant
4/23/22, 18:41 - bad: whwywyy
4/23/22, 18:41 - Ethan: good itself is very broad
4/23/22, 18:41 - Ethan: it can mean quite good, very good, etc.
4/23/22, 18:41 - bad: breh
4/23/22, 18:41 - Ethan: let me sum it up
4/23/22, 18:41 - Ethan: in the universe
4/23/22, 18:41 - Ethan: everything is either good or not good
4/23/22, 18:41 - bad: no
4/23/22, 18:41 - bad: how
4/23/22, 18:41 - Ethan: just like how everything is eityher a banana or not a banana
4/23/22, 18:41 - bad: the universe is noa binary system
4/23/22, 18:41 - Ethan: breee
4/23/22, 18:41 - bad: then what is banana
4/23/22, 18:41 - Ethan: do you NOt GET it
4/23/22, 18:42 - bad: NO
4/23/22, 18:42 - Ethan: IT IS A BANANA
4/23/22, 18:42 - Ethan: dude
4/23/22, 18:42 - bad: SO BANANA = 1
4/23/22, 18:42 - bad: AND NOT BANANA = 0
4/23/22, 18:42 - bad: is that it
4/23/22, 18:42 - Ethan: is this true
4/23/22, 18:42 - Ethan: do yoiu agree
4/23/22, 18:42 - Ethan: it's simple logic
4/23/22, 18:42 - bad: sure
4/23/22, 18:42 - Ethan: yes
4/23/22, 18:42 - bad: but thats not the univrese works
4/23/22, 18:42 - Ethan: so similarl
4/23/22, 18:42 - bad: u dont categorise things like that
4/23/22, 18:42 - Ethan: you dont normally
4/23/22, 18:42 - Ethan: but it's not inherently illogical
4/23/22, 18:42 - Ethan: we are not talking about how we usually do things here
4/23/22, 18:43 - bad: theres a scale
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: we are talking about the fundemental descriptions of something
4/23/22, 18:43 - bad: classification
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: no
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: sigh
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: even if it is slightly good
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: it is still good
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: correct?
4/23/22, 18:43 - bad: no
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: that's how the word works
4/23/22, 18:43 - bad: best > good
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: ok
4/23/22, 18:43 - bad: good > worse
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: something best is good right?
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: ?
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: ?
4/23/22, 18:43 - bad: best is > good
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: best falls under good
4/23/22, 18:43 - bad: not >= good
4/23/22, 18:43 - Ethan: dude
4/23/22, 18:44 - bad: therefore its not
4/23/22, 18:44 - Ethan: dide
4/23/22, 18:44 - bad: lol
4/23/22, 18:44 - bad: lol
4/23/22, 18:44 - Ethan: actualy
4/23/22, 18:44 - Ethan: best is not better than good
4/23/22, 18:44 - bad: ok
4/23/22, 18:44 - bad: maybe best is >= good
4/23/22, 18:44 - Ethan: if we are looking at semantics
4/23/22, 18:44 - bad: best is inside good
4/23/22, 18:44 - Ethan: maybe in specific scenarios
4/23/22, 18:44 - Ethan: but logically it isnt
4/23/22, 18:44 - Ethan: best IS good
4/23/22, 18:44 - bad: no
4/23/22, 18:44 - bad: its inside good
4/23/22, 18:44 - Ethan: do you see the picture im painting now
4/23/22, 18:44 - bad: best∈good
4/23/22, 18:44 - Ethan: bre that's what i mean
4/23/22, 18:44 - Ethan: a square IS a shape right?
4/23/22, 18:45 - bad: yes
4/23/22, 18:45 - Ethan: yes
4/23/22, 18:45 - Ethan: get it?
4/23/22, 18:45 - bad: now ur trying to use the logic of abstraction
4/23/22, 18:45 - bad: which is a thing in java
4/23/22, 18:45 - bad: lol
4/23/22, 18:45 - bad: nice
4/23/22, 18:45 - bad: square extends shape
4/23/22, 18:45 - Ethan: no this is a matter of the underlying principle behind words
4/23/22, 18:45 - Ethan: aka semantics
4/23/22, 18:45 - bad: therefore square instanceof shape
4/23/22, 18:45 - Ethan: best IS good
4/23/22, 18:45 - Ethan: everything in the universe is either good or not good
4/23/22, 18:46 - bad: best extends good
therefore best instanceof good
4/23/22, 18:46 - Ethan: yes
4/23/22, 18:46 - Ethan: best is good
4/23/22, 18:46 - bad: that is true
4/23/22, 18:46 - Ethan: good isnt best
4/23/22, 18:46 - Ethan: ok good
4/23/22, 18:46 - Ethan: so now
4/23/22, 18:46 - bad: but
4/23/22, 18:46 - Ethan: lets ge5t back on the topic
4/23/22, 18:46 - bad: its not the right way to classify things
4/23/22, 18:46 - Ethan: who care's whether it is right; it is logical
4/23/22, 18:46 - Ethan: you're looking at this too perosnally
4/23/22, 18:46 - bad: sure it is logical there are many things that are logical
4/23/22, 18:46 - Ethan: detach yourself from this equation
4/23/22, 18:47 - bad: to classify things
4/23/22, 18:47 - bad: why this
4/23/22, 18:47 - Ethan: by saying that the code is of high quality, aka good,
4/23/22, 18:47 - Ethan: you are basically saying that it CANNOT be bad
4/23/22, 18:47 - Ethan: objectively
4/23/22, 18:47 - bad: because it is NOT bad
4/23/22, 18:47 - Ethan: no one in the world, ni the unvierse, can think it is bad
4/23/22, 18:47 - Ethan: the universe thinks that it is gopd
4/23/22, 18:47 - Ethan: it is a law
4/23/22, 18:47 - Ethan: is that what you're saying
4/23/22, 18:47 - bad: the universe cant think
4/23/22, 18:47 - Ethan: ?
4/23/22, 18:47 - bad: :DDDDDD
4/23/22, 18:48 - Ethan: bre
4/23/22, 18:48 - bad: LOL
4/23/22, 18:48 - Ethan: it's called 0hysics
4/23/22, 18:48 - bad: the universe no brain
4/23/22, 18:48 - Ethan: it's called unviversal laws
4/23/22, 18:48 - Ethan: bre
4/23/22, 18:48 - Ethan: LOOK at the BIG picture
4/23/22, 18:48 - bad: it isnt self conscious
4/23/22, 18:48 - bad: lol
4/23/22, 18:48 - Ethan: it's a metaphor
4/23/22, 18:48 - bad: ok
4/23/22, 18:48 - Ethan: so yes
4/23/22, 18:48 - Ethan: do you get it
4/23/22, 18:48 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 18:48 - bad: er
4/23/22, 18:48 - Ethan: .
4/23/22, 18:48 - Ethan: .
4/23/22, 18:49 - Ethan: .
4/23/22, 18:49 - bad: well they can
4/23/22, 18:49 - Ethan: this is what you are doing
4/23/22, 18:49 - bad: but
4/23/22, 18:49 - bad: it is regarded as good
4/23/22, 18:49 - Ethan: so this terminates it's objectivity
4/23/22, 18:49 - Ethan: dude
4/23/22, 18:49 - Ethan: by WHOM?
4/23/22, 18:49 - bad: i did admit that good is subjective
4/23/22, 18:49 - bad: but logic isnt
4/23/22, 18:49 - bad: most people :D
4/23/22, 18:49 - Ethan: yes but you were referring to the code istself
4/23/22, 18:49 - Ethan: MOST isnt enough
4/23/22, 18:50 - bad: why
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: it has to be 100 PERCENT
4/23/22, 18:50 - bad: no
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: to be objective
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: get it?
4/23/22, 18:50 - bad: its majoirty
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: 100
4/23/22, 18:50 - bad: .
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: ONE HUNDRED
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: yes so
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: your post is subjective
4/23/22, 18:50 - bad: um
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: your code ISNT objectively good
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: until proven so
4/23/22, 18:50 - bad: i dont think so
4/23/22, 18:50 - bad: by who
4/23/22, 18:50 - bad: u?
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: bre by logic
4/23/22, 18:50 - bad: what logic
4/23/22, 18:50 - Ethan: if everyone thinks it is goof then it is
4/23/22, 18:51 - bad: how does logic prove my code is good
4/23/22, 18:51 - Ethan: you have to prove this
4/23/22, 18:51 - Ethan: everyone
4/23/22, 18:51 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 18:51 - Ethan: the universe included
4/23/22, 18:51 - bad: everyone
4/23/22, 18:51 - Ethan: every organism
4/23/22, 18:51 - bad: how tf am i suppose to get earth to read my code
4/23/22, 18:51 - Ethan: exactly
4/23/22, 18:51 - Ethan: precisely why i said that it's impossible to be objectuve
4/23/22, 18:51 - bad: breh
4/23/22, 18:51 - Ethan: yes
4/23/22, 18:51 - bad: i think u are changing th emeaning of objective
4/23/22, 18:51 - bad: breh
4/23/22, 18:51 - Ethan: bro
4/23/22, 18:51 - Ethan: BRO
4/23/22, 18:51 - bad: thats  not how it works
4/23/22, 18:52 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 18:52 - Ethan: it means that WHOEVER YOU ARE, the determinatiuon of its goodness will be the samer
4/23/22, 18:52 - Ethan: can you accomplish that?
4/23/22, 18:52 - Ethan: detahc yourself i mean
4/23/22, 18:52 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 18:52 - Ethan: detach
4/23/22, 18:52 - bad: what that mean
4/23/22, 18:52 - Ethan: look at this form an impersonal perspective
4/23/22, 18:52 - Ethan: completely
4/23/22, 18:53 - bad: er ok
4/23/22, 18:53 - bad: and wat
4/23/22, 18:53 - Ethan: yes
4/23/22, 18:53 - Ethan: so it cannot be objectively good
4/23/22, 18:53 - bad: ofc it cant
4/23/22, 18:53 - bad: i alr said that
4/23/22, 18:53 - bad: but its still good tho
4/23/22, 18:53 - bad: :)
4/23/22, 18:54 - Ethan: this here is subjective
4/23/22, 18:54 - Ethan: bro
4/23/22, 18:54 - Ethan: actually you know what
4/23/22, 18:54 - bad: yes it is
4/23/22, 18:54 - bad: lol
4/23/22, 18:54 - Ethan: you're not breaking any laws of logic by saying that
4/23/22, 18:54 - bad: LLLLl
4/23/22, 18:54 - Ethan: you speak from a personal point of view
4/23/22, 18:54 - bad: suc
4/23/22, 18:54 - bad: L universe
4/23/22, 18:54 - Ethan: there's not detachment
4/23/22, 18:54 - Ethan: no
4/23/22, 18:54 - Ethan: so yes i cam argue that it isnt comepletely good
4/23/22, 18:55 - Ethan: not 100%
4/23/22, 18:55 - Ethan: it's impossible to be
4/23/22, 18:55 - bad: yay
4/23/22, 18:55 - bad: now ur arguing for me
4/23/22, 18:55 - Ethan: you can claim that
4/23/22, 18:55 - bad: :D
4/23/22, 18:55 - Ethan: there's nothing wrong
4/23/22, 18:55 - Ethan: how
4/23/22, 18:55 - bad: yaaaa
4/23/22, 18:55 - Ethan: .
4/23/22, 18:55 - bad: usucucucucsc
4/23/22, 18:55 - Ethan: can
4/23/22, 18:55 - bad: my code is good
4/23/22, 18:55 - bad: heheheha
4/23/22, 18:55 - Ethan: im just saying that you should refrain by treating things as objective truths
4/23/22, 18:56 - Ethan: you can think that it is good but accept thaty it isnt at the same time
4/23/22, 18:56 - bad: to the people who see my status
4/23/22, 18:56 - bad: yes
4/23/22, 18:56 - Ethan: i hope you understand this
4/23/22, 18:56 - Ethan: because to be good
4/23/22, 18:56 - Ethan: in it's essence
4/23/22, 18:56 - Ethan: it has to be objectively good
4/23/22, 18:56 - Ethan: its.
4/23/22, 18:56 - bad: yes i know
4/23/22, 18:57 - Ethan: so you know it isnt good
4/23/22, 18:57 - Ethan: but also good
4/23/22, 18:57 - bad: yaa
4/23/22, 18:57 - Ethan: differentiuate the two
4/23/22, 18:57 - bad: majority
4/23/22, 18:57 - bad: wins
4/23/22, 18:57 - bad: so its good
4/23/22, 18:57 - Ethan: bre what
4/23/22, 18:57 - Ethan: how is it majority
4/23/22, 18:57 - bad: what
4/23/22, 18:57 - bad: most peope\le
4/23/22, 18:57 - bad: not 100%
4/23/22, 18:57 - bad: but
4/23/22, 18:57 - bad: most people
4/23/22, 18:57 - Ethan: you have to assume everyone in the universe will consider it good upon seeing it
4/23/22, 18:58 - Ethan: not just those who actually saw them
4/23/22, 18:58 - bad: u see
4/23/22, 18:58 - bad: im not sending it to everyone in the universe
4/23/22, 18:58 - Ethan: dude
4/23/22, 18:58 - bad: why
4/23/22, 18:58 - Ethan: that's not how it works
4/23/22, 18:58 - bad: its called target audeicne
4/23/22, 18:58 - Ethan: if i have shitty apple
4/23/22, 18:58 - Ethan: and only i see it
4/23/22, 18:58 - Ethan: does it mean it is actually good?
4/23/22, 18:58 - bad: do u think its good?
4/23/22, 18:58 - Ethan: because "majority wins" and it's just me
4/23/22, 18:58 - Ethan: personally yes but it isnt objectively good
4/23/22, 18:59 - bad: it is
4/23/22, 18:59 - bad: no one else seen it
4/23/22, 18:59 - Ethan: bre
4/23/22, 18:59 - bad: therefore they havent made a choice yet
4/23/22, 18:59 - Ethan: you cant think like that
4/23/22, 18:59 - bad: why
4/23/22, 18:59 - Ethan: something isnt limited to it's physical audience
4/23/22, 18:59 - Ethan: things
4/23/22, 18:59 - bad: sure u can imagine how people would think towards it
4/23/22, 18:59 - Ethan: it isnt limited to the opinion of like one person
4/23/22, 19:00 - Ethan: dude
4/23/22, 19:00 - Ethan: dont look at this so peronsally
4/23/22, 19:00 - bad: ya but the person has to give opinion first
4/23/22, 19:00 - Ethan: it hasd nothing to do with the individual
4/23/22, 19:00 - bad: but
4/23/22, 19:00 - bad: "good" is a thought
4/23/22, 19:00 - bad: its a opinion
4/23/22, 19:00 - bad: made by a indivuidal
4/23/22, 19:00 - Ethan: yes but it is negligible considering the actual opinions floting around in the universe
4/23/22, 19:00 - bad: idgaf about the universe
4/23/22, 19:00 - bad: :D
4/23/22, 19:00 - bad: and also
4/23/22, 19:00 - bad: THE UNIVERSE CANT THINK
4/23/22, 19:01 - Ethan: bre
4/23/22, 19:01 - Ethan: ok let me put it this way
4/23/22, 19:01 - bad: ok u know what
4/23/22, 19:01 - bad: can i just say that everyrthing has a scope
4/23/22, 19:01 - Ethan: personally, you can think that it is objectively good
4/23/22, 19:01 - Ethan: but it's very subjective
4/23/22, 19:01 - Ethan: wdym by scope
4/23/22, 19:01 - bad: like
4/23/22, 19:01 - bad: good as in
4/23/22, 19:02 - bad: no universe
4/23/22, 19:02 - bad: only some people
4/23/22, 19:02 - Ethan: YOU personally can
4/23/22, 19:02 - bad: lol
4/23/22, 19:02 - Ethan: it depends on your own definition of good
4/23/22, 19:02 - Ethan: there's nothing wrong with your opinion not matching that of the universe as whole
4/23/22, 19:02 - Ethan: but humans generally tend ot sync their logic with the actual deak
4/23/22, 19:02 - bad: ZTHE UNIVERSE DOEST HAVE A OPNINION
4/23/22, 19:02 - Ethan: LOFGIC
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: LOGIC IS IT"S OPINION
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: DUDE
4/23/22, 19:03 - bad: ITS A NON LIVING THING
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: BRTO
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: LOGIC
4/23/22, 19:03 - bad: :)
4/23/22, 19:03 - bad: what
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: IT"s CALLED LOGIC
4/23/22, 19:03 - bad: logic isnt an opninon
4/23/22, 19:03 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: it is
4/23/22, 19:03 - bad: its a flow to do things
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: it is the ovjective opinion
4/23/22, 19:03 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: and everything follows the "opinion" of the universe
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: aka logic
4/23/22, 19:03 - bad: breh
4/23/22, 19:03 - bad: what
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: tangible aspects at least
4/23/22, 19:03 - Ethan: mentally you can be as illogical as you esny
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: DO YOU NOT GET METAPHORS
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: LIKE ACTUALLY
4/23/22, 19:04 - bad: er
4/23/22, 19:04 - bad: maybe
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: 拟人
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: NIREN
4/23/22, 19:04 - bad: ok
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: NIREN
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: N
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: I
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: R
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: E
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: N
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: NIREN
4/23/22, 19:04 - bad: no
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: ok so
4/23/22, 19:04 - Ethan: do you understand know how it all works
4/23/22, 19:05 - bad: no
4/23/22, 19:05 - Ethan: ok
4/23/22, 19:05 - bad: the universe is too big
4/23/22, 19:05 - bad: so
4/23/22, 19:05 - Ethan: it is physiucally
4/23/22, 19:05 - Ethan: but everything, how it works is really not all that big
4/23/22, 19:05 - Ethan: in fact
4/23/22, 19:05 - bad: are u saying u know how the universe works
4/23/22, 19:05 - bad: :OOOOOO
4/23/22, 19:06 - bad: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
4/23/22, 19:06 - Ethan: it is actually surprising how erasy humans were able to categorise physics
4/23/22, 19:06 - Ethan: it is a surprise how organised the universe is
4/23/22, 19:06 - bad: are u sure about that
4/23/22, 19:06 - bad: u cannot make such conlcusions
4/23/22, 19:06 - Ethan: in the sense that it is very predictable
4/23/22, 19:06 - bad: when we only like 0.1% of the universe
4/23/22, 19:06 - Ethan: bre scientists themselves said thaT
4/23/22, 19:06 - Ethan: UH
4/23/22, 19:06 - bad: no prove
4/23/22, 19:06 - Ethan: not even
4/23/22, 19:06 - bad: dont give a f
4/23/22, 19:06 - Ethan: physically
4/23/22, 19:06 - bad: exaggeration
4/23/22, 19:06 - bad: :)
4/23/22, 19:07 - Ethan: why are you goign against your point
4/23/22, 19:07 - Ethan: lol
4/23/22, 19:07 - bad: wat
4/23/22, 19:07 - bad: whats my point
4/23/22, 19:07 - Ethan: that we make up a small part of the universe
4/23/22, 19:07 - Ethan: anyways
4/23/22, 19:07 - bad: we do
4/23/22, 19:07 - Ethan: you went against your point by exaggerating the figure
4/23/22, 19:07 - bad: breh
4/23/22, 19:07 - bad: how
4/23/22, 19:08 - Ethan: sigh nvm
4/23/22, 19:08 - Ethan: anyways
4/23/22, 19:08 - bad: how tf would i know how much we nkow about the universe
4/23/22, 19:08 - Ethan: the logic and organised state of the universe might not last forever
4/23/22, 19:08 - Ethan: you see
4/23/22, 19:08 - Ethan: there's something called entropy
4/23/22, 19:08 - Ethan: any system is bound to spiral into chaos
4/23/22, 19:08 - bad: er
4/23/22, 19:08 - bad: r u sure about that
4/23/22, 19:08 - Ethan: yes
4/23/22, 19:08 - bad: why
4/23/22, 19:08 - Ethan: second law of thermodynamics
4/23/22, 19:09 - Ethan: i think
4/23/22, 19:09 - bad: breh
4/23/22, 19:09 - Ethan: chaos is always the end result
4/23/22, 19:09 - bad: ok i gotta dinner now
4/23/22, 19:09 - bad: so er
4/23/22, 19:09 - Ethan: as in it mixes such that it becomes undefinable
4/23/22, 19:09 - bad: bye
4/23/22, 19:09 - Ethan: ok
4/23/22, 19:09 - Ethan: bye
4/24/22, 15:10 - Ethan: lmao compare this to the apollo lunar lander
4/24/22, 15:11 - Ethan: also you can actually connect to a quantum computer via cloud
4/24/22, 15:11 - Ethan: so that's interesting
4/24/22, 16:01 - bad: wat
4/24/22, 16:01 - bad: can i steal their ram
4/24/22, 16:02 - Ethan: bre i dont think so
4/24/22, 16:03 - Ethan: actually im not sure hm probably not it's mostly used to run big programs
4/24/22, 16:03 - bad: :(
4/24/22, 22:01 - bad: the rat controls it?
4/24/22, 22:02 - bad: or just energy transfer
4/24/22, 22:02 - Ethan: bre it's neurons
4/24/22, 22:02 - Ethan: commands the wheels
4/24/22, 22:02 - Ethan: it senses it's physical environment from the lights
4/24/22, 22:03 - Ethan: i wonder how they managed to hook up the robot to the rat's brain with such precision
4/24/22, 22:03 - bad: so they can read rat mind
4/24/22, 22:04 - Ethan: vaguely
4/24/22, 22:04 - bad: nice
4/24/22, 22:04 - bad: L rat
4/24/22, 22:04 - Ethan: i think they associate certain patterns of neuron activity to certain directions
4/24/22, 22:04 - Ethan: and then convert it into motion in the wheels'
4/24/22, 22:04 - bad: ok
4/24/22, 22:04 - bad: rat car
4/24/22, 22:05 - Ethan: reminds me of brain in vat
4/24/22, 22:06 - bad: what
4/24/22, 22:06 - Ethan: uh you know what just search that up yourself
4/24/22, 22:06 - Ethan: it's really interesting
4/24/22, 22:06 - bad: hm
4/24/22, 22:07 - Ethan: extremely speculative tho, although it could be applicable
4/24/22, 22:07 - Ethan: i mean, fundementally our conscious self if basically just the brain right
4/24/22, 22:07 - Ethan: fundamentally
4/24/22, 22:07 - bad: yaaa
4/24/22, 22:07 - bad: lil brain cells
4/24/22, 22:08 - Ethan: uh i think it's the same size us ours
4/24/22, 22:08 - bad: what if i put some rat brain cells in my brain
4/24/22, 22:08 - Ethan: intelligence is defined by the amount of neurons no the siuze
4/24/22, 22:08 - bad: wat
4/24/22, 22:08 - Ethan: bre you mean just inject it or what
4/24/22, 22:08 - bad: so i just dump some neurons
4/24/22, 22:08 - bad: and im genius
4/24/22, 22:08 - bad: maybe
4/24/22, 22:08 - Ethan: no
4/24/22, 22:08 - Ethan: i dont thiknk it's that easy
4/24/22, 22:08 - bad: er
4/24/22, 22:08 - bad: try it
4/24/22, 22:08 - bad: :)
4/24/22, 22:08 - Ethan: how do i get neurons
4/24/22, 22:08 - bad: just poke a hole
4/24/22, 22:09 - bad: open the brain
4/24/22, 22:09 - bad: from a rat
4/24/22, 22:09 - bad: or moneky
4/24/22, 22:09 - Ethan: HOL ON
4/24/22, 22:09 - Ethan: i think it's possible
4/24/22, 22:09 - bad: YAAAAAAAAA
4/24/22, 22:09 - bad: IM GENIUS
4/24/22, 22:09 - Ethan: bre but you dont become more intelligent
4/24/22, 22:10 - bad: wat
4/24/22, 22:10 - bad: why
4/24/22, 22:10 - bad: a
4/24/22, 22:10 - Ethan: i think
4/24/22, 22:10 - bad: breh
4/24/22, 22:10 - Ethan: theoratically speaking, it can make you intelligenter
4/24/22, 22:11 - Ethan: why isnt intlligenter a word
4/24/22, 22:11 - bad: more intelligent
4/24/22, 22:11 - bad: breh
4/24/22, 22:11 - Ethan: but it's a bell curve
4/24/22, 22:11 - bad: just say
4/24/22, 22:11 - bad: smarter
4/24/22, 22:11 - Ethan: they have diufferent meanings
4/24/22, 22:11 - bad: same thing
4/24/22, 22:11 - Ethan: meaning, i think it drops afterwards
4/24/22, 22:11 - bad: whay
4/24/22, 22:11 - bad: so i cant havr too many
4/24/22, 22:12 - Ethan: Bre
4/24/22, 22:12 - Ethan: You actually can
4/24/22, 22:12 - bad: wont i vecome dum
4/24/22, 22:12 - bad: like a plant
4/24/22, 22:13 - bad: lol
4/24/22, 22:13 - Ethan: What
4/24/22, 22:13 - Ethan: So you do become cognitively impired
4/24/22, 22:13 - bad: yes
4/24/22, 22:13 - bad: are planrs intelligent
4/24/22, 22:13 - Ethan: Probably, and I'm being very speculative, due to overactivity
4/24/22, 22:13 - Ethan: That depends
4/24/22, 22:13 - bad: well do they even havw nieurons
4/24/22, 22:14 - Ethan: Huh
4/24/22, 22:14 - bad: plants
4/24/22, 22:14 - bad: no brain
4/24/22, 22:14 - bad: therefore dum
4/24/22, 22:14 - Ethan: No pmao
4/24/22, 22:14 - Ethan: Lmao
4/24/22, 22:14 - bad: what
4/24/22, 22:14 - Ethan: They don't have a brain
4/24/22, 22:14 - Ethan: BUT
4/24/22, 22:14 - bad: wher rf they get neurons ftom
4/24/22, 22:14 - bad: the soil?
4/24/22, 22:14 - bad: lol
4/24/22, 22:14 - Ethan: They Dont
4/24/22, 22:14 - Ethan: Bre
4/24/22, 22:14 - bad: what
4/24/22, 22:14 - Ethan: Bro
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: so its in the seed
4/24/22, 22:15 - Ethan: THEY DONT
4/24/22, 22:15 - Ethan: Have
4/24/22, 22:15 - Ethan: Neurons
4/24/22, 22:15 - Ethan: I think
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: oh
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: then
4/24/22, 22:15 - Ethan: It doesn't make sense
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: then what
4/24/22, 22:15 - Ethan: So yea they are not intelligent
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: LLLLL
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: PLANTS SUCK
4/24/22, 22:15 - Ethan: They can transmit information
4/24/22, 22:15 - Ethan: In fact fun fact
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: but they can reach more sunlight
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: for
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: somehow
4/24/22, 22:15 - Ethan: They can "communicate" with each other
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: er
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: how do they understand
4/24/22, 22:15 - bad: without a brain
4/24/22, 22:16 - Ethan: For example, if a plant were to be attacked by a parasite, some species can release some sort of information via a medium through the roots warning the others
4/24/22, 22:16 - Ethan: You don't need a brain yo understand something
4/24/22, 22:16 - bad: what
4/24/22, 22:16 - bad: yes u do
4/24/22, 22:16 - bad: like a languge
4/24/22, 22:16 - bad: a signal
4/24/22, 22:16 - bad: u reiceive it
4/24/22, 22:17 - bad: but u dk what it means
4/24/22, 22:17 - Ethan: Well I would say they have to know what it means in order to react to it
4/24/22, 22:18 - bad: so its hars coded
4/24/22, 22:18 - bad: lol
4/24/22, 22:18 - bad: hard
4/24/22, 22:18 - Ethan: Obviously it can't just evolve to be intelligent across its lifetime
4/24/22, 22:19 - Ethan: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/02/plants-talk-to-each-other-through-their-roots
4/24/22, 22:19 - bad: humans do that
4/24/22, 22:19 - Ethan: ....s.e.e.
4/24/22, 22:19 - Ethan: They don't grow intelligence
4/24/22, 22:19 - bad: ok
4/24/22, 22:19 - bad: so its hard coded
4/24/22, 22:19 - bad: dum plants
4/24/22, 22:19 - Ethan: Bre
4/24/22, 22:20 - Ethan: Here's some info about it
4/24/22, 22:20 - bad: ya
4/24/22, 22:20 - bad: a

4/27/22, 18:48 - bad: sure
4/27/22, 18:48 - bad: :D
4/27/22, 18:50 - Ethan: Ti = introverted Thinking.

Cold, impartial reasoning that derives its criteria primarily from principles. Ti focuses more on building a model of how things work than how things are. How the cogs turn is more important than what that turning accomplishes.

Keywords: Model-oriented, Accuracy, Observer

Te = extroverted Thinking.

Cold, impartial reasoning that focuses on evaluating the outside world - what we have at hand, what can be accomplished. Theory is a tool, the current and desired states of things the heart of the matter.

Keywords: State-oriented, Effectiveness, Control

Fe = extroverted Feeling.

A judging function dealing with emotion and sentiment - ie. criteria of desirability - with a marked focus on the social atmosphere: How are people doing, is the situation pleasant for everyone involved, and so on. Tendency to like cooperation. When benevolent, is concerned with the wellbeing of everyone and the smooth functioning of the group they're in. Pays attention to expression of sentiment before its motivation.

Keywords: Connecting, Harmonious, Expression-focused

Fi = introverted Feeling.

Judging function that deals in emotion and sentiment. Criteria of desirability are drawn primarily from within the person. Concerned with being authentic, doing what feels right to the self before what is correct. Looks for the motivation behind an expression of sentiment first rather than reacting to the expression itself.

Keywords: Valuing, Authentic, Motive-focused

Se = Extroverted Sensing.

A perception function that focuses on direct, as-little-processing-as-possible perception of the concrete reality around us, and being in tune with the here and now, living in the moment. Quite physical in nature.

Keywords: Sensation, Immediate, Physical

Si = Introverted Sensing.

An attitude that values how something concretely impacts the person. Si is a perception function that lets the concrete sensations of life come in, impact the self, and dwelling on this experience of experiencing. These experiences are very visceral to the Si type, sometimes forming accurate reconstructions of past experience down to smells and sounds, and so weigh heavily on an Si type's mind. When met with a situation, an Si type tends to refer to these stored models of how situations unfolded to act with the certainty and confidence of a person who's seen it already. In a way, Si is the historian of the person.

Keywords: Experience, Impression, Visceral

Ne = extroverted Intuition.

An expansive, fast, brainstorming function that sees connections and possibilities as inhering in the objects and ideas it beholds. Needs only a small springboard to launch into a flurry of excited action, hopping from one possibility to another. Like Se, focuses on the direct observation rather than the impression the observation leaves on the person. Ne tends to touch many things lightly, instead of a few with depth. Goes from one observation to many exciting ideas.

Keywords: Explorative, Playful, Connecting, Change

Ni = introverted Intuition.

A condensing function that grasps at the essence of the thing and deals with it in a vague form that is hard to put to words. Largely unconscious even in a dominant type, Ni takes in a large amount of context, finds patterns in them and distills the context into a singular, holistic, understanding. Ni is largely concerned with understanding a thing's character, what about it makes it what it is, in an experiential sense.

Keywords: Condensing, Holistic, Character of the thing, Symbols
4/27/22, 18:50 - Ethan: rank your top 4
4/27/22, 18:51 - bad: uhhahh
4/27/22, 18:51 - bad: its pick one for each right
4/27/22, 18:52 - Ethan: choose the top 4 which you relate to and rank them accordingly
4/27/22, 18:52 - Ethan: there are 8
4/27/22, 18:52 - bad: no i mean
4/27/22, 18:52 - bad: theres intro extro thinking
4/27/22, 18:53 - bad: thens therss sensing
4/27/22, 18:53 - bad: intuitiob
4/27/22, 18:53 - bad: and something
4/27/22, 18:53 - Ethan: nope view them seperately
4/27/22, 18:53 - bad: oh
4/27/22, 18:53 - bad: breh
4/27/22, 18:53 - bad: can i just view tjem like that so its easier
4/27/22, 18:53 - bad: :)
4/27/22, 18:53 - bad: te fi si ne
4/27/22, 18:53 - Ethan: interesting
4/27/22, 18:54 - Ethan: oki got your supposed type
4/27/22, 18:54 - Ethan: let me find some articles
4/27/22, 18:55 - bad: ok
4/27/22, 18:55 - Ethan: https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ESTJ#:~:text=ESTJ%20indicates%20a%20person%20who,spontaneous%20and%20flexible%20(Judging).
4/27/22, 18:55 - Ethan: hm doesnt exactly fit
4/27/22, 18:55 - bad: lol
4/27/22, 18:55 - bad: sucucuc
4/27/22, 18:55 - Ethan: if it doesnt match i'll send a different description
4/27/22, 18:55 - Ethan: tell me if it matches
4/27/22, 18:55 - bad: ok it kinda does
4/27/22, 18:56 - Ethan: ah interesting
4/27/22, 18:56 - Ethan: https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ENTJ how about this
4/27/22, 18:57 - Ethan: https://www.truity.com/personality-type/INTP
4/27/22, 18:57 - bad: maybe thats why ive been lecturing cheng on code inefficiency
4/27/22, 18:57 - Ethan: which one resonates with you out of these 3
4/27/22, 18:57 - Ethan: oh
4/27/22, 18:57 - Ethan: very interesting
4/27/22, 18:58 - Ethan: it all falls into place huh
4/27/22, 18:58 - Ethan: take a quick look at this
4/27/22, 18:58 - bad: that u
4/27/22, 18:58 - bad: lol
4/27/22, 18:58 - Ethan: uh okay

4/27/22, 19:36 - bad: ok maybe this
4/27/22, 19:42 - Ethan: Interesting
4/27/22, 19:43 - Ethan: I am an ENTJ 3w4 and I would assume we are the type that works absolutely hardest, with success as our primary motivator. Take a look at many individuals in investment banking, they work 100 hours a week and are fascinated by being able to accrue as much money as possible. Many are unscrupulous and have no regard for their peers, doing everything they can to climb the ladder. I would say these individuals are archetypes of the ENTJ 3w4. A 8w7 would probably be more interested in being the leader and be seen as a powerful character for the sake of it, such as the character 'Jim Rennie'. A 8w7 would probably be more social and outgoing, aswell as more aggressive whereas a 3w4 is very motivated by success and perceived as more of a recluse.

A 3w4 probably lies about himself just to be seen as more of a success because he can't stand being on the same level as everyone else. I used to do this when I was unhealthy, but now I try to be as honest as possible and bask in my accomplishments.

I am fascinated by accumulating as much money as possible to distinguish myself from others, I see most people (>95%) as lazy drones with no ambition or mental fortitude and I really want to avoid these kind of people because they are not on my level. I would say I have strong narcissistic tendencies and I believe very many 3w4 do. Being an ENTJ, I prefer to excel in more intellectual subjects whereas an ESTP 3w4 would likely fantasize about being the greatest football player.
4/27/22, 19:45 - Ethan: What is the Core Desire of the ENTJ 3w4?
The core desire of the ENTJ 3w4 is to be successful and be seen as successful. To achieve this, they work super hard at their jobs or careers.

What is the Core Fear of the ENTJ 3w4?

4/27/22, 20:26 - Ethan: this is..surprising to say the least
4/27/22, 20:27 - bad: WHY
4/27/22, 20:27 - Ethan: such assessments are not usually so accurate
4/27/22, 20:27 - Ethan: so you relate to every single point?
4/27/22, 20:27 - Ethan: like each an every one
4/27/22, 20:27 - bad: they only seem accurate because they are very general
4/27/22, 20:27 - bad: yes
4/27/22, 20:27 - Ethan: from these three different articles
4/27/22, 20:27 - Ethan: yes that is true
4/27/22, 20:27 - bad: no i javent read rhat

4/27/22, 20:28 - Ethan: it's what makes suh tests so popular
4/27/22, 20:28 - bad: what
4/27/22, 20:28 - Ethan: but i tried to narrow it down as much as i could
4/27/22, 20:28 - bad: hmm
4/27/22, 20:28 - Ethan: :/
4/27/22, 20:47 - Ethan: uh can you do me a favour
4/27/22, 20:48 - Ethan: since you're apparently able to pin down people's personality types, can you provide your opinion on mine; ill send the comparison
4/27/22, 20:48 - Ethan: you can just do it intuitively or something i need external perspectives
4/27/22, 20:51 - Ethan: I struggled with this as well because many just say it's a preference of science vs. art. I think this is way too much of a generalization since 5s enjoy both science and art. I prefer writing and music to physics and math, but that doesn't make me a 5w4. I came to a different conclusion as to the difference between the two wings, basing it on what influences their creativity:

5w4s' creativity is more genuinely and naturally original. Their creativity draws from their 4 wing, which is individualistic and unique. They don't care for norms so much that they just ignore them. Their creativity looks inward on the individual's personal experiences, thoughts, or emotions.

5w6s' creativity, on the other hand, is influenced more by what others are doing. Their creativity draws from their 6 wing, which is more focused on norms, whether that means to follow or break those norms. Their creativity looks outward to what others are doing either to see what does or does not work or to see if something has already been done before.

To put it more simply, 5w6s try to solve a problem by thinking either inside or outside the box, while 5w4s just don't see a box at all. 5w6s may pride themselves on their ability to think unconventionally, while 5w4s just don't care about convention.
4/27/22, 20:52 - Ethan: INTPs are likely to hurt people's feelings, on purpose AND by accident. I actually think it's good for people to have their ideas, feelings and egos challenged constantly, but it's hard to know (or care) when I've pushed too far. INTP also corrects people when they are wrong, almost 100% of the time, and judges/criticizes the actions of ourselves and others relatively harshly. Again, I truly see this as being helpful, honest and genuine, and that any other demeanor would be hypocritical. INTP's tendency is to (attempt to) tell people what (we think) they need to hear, not what they want to hear. I'll also go as far as to say that our relationships are generally more superficial in most ways.

INFPs usually take a more harmonious approach to interacting with others and have a more live-and-let-live attitude towards the lives of others. They are far less likely to make offensive jokes and statements, and far less critical and judgmental of others. They have way more emotional fortitude, and are able to understand and engage people on a less superficial level. INFPs know where they stand with others, and understand how they feel about basically everything in their lives. I also believe that INFP cares far more about how they are perceived by others.

4/29/22, 18:04 - Ethan: I have a feeling this isn't exactly working out because java might be slightly too advanced for a beginner so I might go with python first

5/6/22, 18:05 - Ethan: A time limit is mroe accurate
5/6/22, 18:05 - bad: i assume thats the standard

5/6/22, 18:11 - bad: :)
5/6/22, 18:11 - Ethan: Then what's the poin
5/6/22, 18:11 - Ethan: T
5/6/22, 18:11 - bad: nah
5/6/22, 18:11 - Ethan: Here's a paradox
5/6/22, 18:11 - bad: there are lots of people
5/6/22, 18:11 - bad: like mayb 10
5/6/22, 18:11 - bad: +
5/6/22, 18:11 - Ethan: They say people who keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result each time are insane
5/6/22, 18:11 - Ethan: But that's the definition of practice makes perfect
5/6/22, 18:11 - bad: what
5/6/22, 18:11 - bad: no
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: when u practice u do it better
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: breh
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: breh
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: breh
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: breg
5/6/22, 18:12 - Ethan: That's not necessarily true
5/6/22, 18:12 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:12 - Ethan: I don't think that's practice
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: ok
5/6/22, 18:12 - Ethan: Dhde
5/6/22, 18:12 - Ethan: Dude
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: IF practice makes perfect
5/6/22, 18:12 - Ethan: So yes a cool paradox
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: then on avetage
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: each practice gets u closer to perfect
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: see
5/6/22, 18:12 - Ethan: I guess
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: .
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: so its trie
5/6/22, 18:12 - bad: breh
5/6/22, 18:12 - Ethan: But maybe you mimick the action
5/6/22, 18:13 - Ethan: And get familiar each time
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: ya
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: get better
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: its not SAME
5/6/22, 18:13 - Ethan: So you don't change the way you practice
5/6/22, 18:13 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:13 - Ethan: It literally is
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: its not ==
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: no its not
5/6/22, 18:13 - Ethan: You're doing the same thing but internally you are shifting
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: the fact that it becomes perfevt
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: its not the SAME
5/6/22, 18:13 - Ethan: .
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: u PERFECT it
5/6/22, 18:13 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: yes
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: MIMICL
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: not SAM
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: E
5/6/22, 18:13 - bad: dude
5/6/22, 18:13 - Ethan: So uou keep mimicking it
5/6/22, 18:13 - Ethan: Meaning you keep doing the same thing
5/6/22, 18:14 - bad: u cant say mimicking
5/6/22, 18:14 - Ethan: But you become more familiar
5/6/22, 18:14 - bad: its perfecting
5/6/22, 18:14 - Ethan: You perfect it by mimicking it
5/6/22, 18:14 - bad: like in machine learning
5/6/22, 18:14 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:14 - bad: u do the same thing
5/6/22, 18:14 - bad: in an attempt to perfevt the output
5/6/22, 18:14 - Ethan: Mimicking means you attempt yo perform at the ideal state
5/6/22, 18:14 - bad: HOW DOES IT NOT MAKE SENSE
5/6/22, 18:14 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:14 - Ethan: It doesnt
5/6/22, 18:14 - bad: what no
5/6/22, 18:14 - Ethan: What
5/6/22, 18:14 - bad: <Media omitted>
5/6/22, 18:14 - bad: dude
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: its imitate
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: its trying to vopy
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: copy
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: is not same
5/6/22, 18:15 - Ethan: So?
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: dude
5/6/22, 18:15 - Ethan: Dude
5/6/22, 18:15 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:15 - Ethan: How is it not the same
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: and mimickimg is the wrong word
5/6/22, 18:15 - Ethan: .
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: its PERFECTING
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: .
5/6/22, 18:15 - Ethan: You mimic to perfect it
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: .
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: no u dont
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: u run algorithms
5/6/22, 18:15 - Ethan: Thats different
5/6/22, 18:15 - bad: aka practice
5/6/22, 18:15 - Ethan: Yoy don't mimic it
5/6/22, 18:16 - Ethan: You change the factors
5/6/22, 18:16 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:16 - bad: EXACTLY
5/6/22, 18:16 - bad: ITS NOT SAME
5/6/22, 18:16 - Ethan: You mimic the idea state
5/6/22, 18:16 - bad: ARE U SAYING PRACTICING CHANGES NOTHING??
5/6/22, 18:16 - bad: u wouldnt know the idel state
5/6/22, 18:16 - bad: 🤦‍♂️
5/6/22, 18:16 - Ethan: Bru what are you on about
5/6/22, 18:17 - Ethan: You remain the same externally
5/6/22, 18:17 - bad: if u knew u would litetally do it
5/6/22, 18:17 - Ethan: But you get useful to jt itnetnally
5/6/22, 18:17 - bad: huh??0
5/6/22, 18:17 - bad: no?p
5/6/22, 18:17 - Ethan: Dude
5/6/22, 18:17 - Ethan: Dude
5/6/22, 18:17 - bad: yes
5/6/22, 18:17 - Ethan: We all know the action of professional sportsmen
5/6/22, 18:17 - Ethan: Doesn't mean we know how to do it
5/6/22, 18:17 - bad: u practice to perfect the factors
5/6/22, 18:17 - Ethan: By repeating it
5/6/22, 18:17 - bad: repeating it, each time better and better
5/6/22, 18:17 - Ethan: perform (an activity) or exercise (a skill) repeatedly or regularly in order to acquire, improve or maintain proficiency in it.
5/6/22, 18:17 - bad: since they change the factora
5/6/22, 18:18 - Ethan: Define better
5/6/22, 18:18 - bad: closer to perfect
5/6/22, 18:18 - Ethan: Bre not shit I meant are you more familiar with the action or are getting closer to the ideal result
5/6/22, 18:18 - bad: u cant change nothing and magically become perfect
5/6/22, 18:19 - bad: huh
5/6/22, 18:19 - Ethan: used to say that people become better at something if they do it often If you want to be a good writer, you should write every day. Remember, practice makes perfect.
5/6/22, 18:19 - Ethan: Write everyday
5/6/22, 18:19 - Ethan: How are you supposed to know if you are improving
5/6/22, 18:19 - bad: first statement is subjective
5/6/22, 18:19 - Ethan: You are not necessarily aiming to improve
5/6/22, 18:19 - bad: in machine learnimg
5/6/22, 18:19 - bad: at least
5/6/22, 18:19 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:19 - bad: there is an algorithm to calculate loss
5/6/22, 18:20 - bad: by lowering the loss u are improving
5/6/22, 18:20 - Ethan: That's machine learning
5/6/22, 18:20 - Ethan: We are not machines
5/6/22, 18:20 - bad: its the practice makes perfect
5/6/22, 18:20 - bad: PRACTICE DOESNT HAVE TO BE LIMITED TO HUMANS
5/6/22, 18:20 - bad: DUDE
5/6/22, 18:20 - Ethan: You cant calculate lose when writing
5/6/22, 18:20 - Ethan: In the conventional sense it's targeted at humans
5/6/22, 18:20 - bad: u can do it in othrt ways
5/6/22, 18:20 - bad: reading ur reviews
5/6/22, 18:20 - bad: rating
5/6/22, 18:20 - Ethan: Thats really flimsy isn't it
5/6/22, 18:20 - Ethan: Depends on the individual
5/6/22, 18:21 - bad: but its not limited to
5/6/22, 18:21 - Ethan: You can't accurately gauge your improvement
5/6/22, 18:21 - bad: and in sports
5/6/22, 18:21 - Ethan: Anymore
5/6/22, 18:21 - bad: u just be higher on the ranking
5/6/22, 18:21 - bad: or somethong
5/6/22, 18:21 - bad: win competitoon
5/6/22, 18:21 - Ethan: What if others become worse
5/6/22, 18:21 - bad: then idk
5/6/22, 18:21 - Ethan: Yes so
5/6/22, 18:22 - Ethan: Not everythign jn thr real world is so technical
5/6/22, 18:22 - bad: yes
5/6/22, 18:22 - bad: but some things are
5/6/22, 18:22 - bad: sometime skill can be measured
5/6/22, 18:22 - Ethan: But as accurately as machines?
5/6/22, 18:22 - bad: well then
5/6/22, 18:22 - bad: how would u desvribe perfevt
5/6/22, 18:22 - bad: since nothing is perfect
5/6/22, 18:23 - Ethan: That's not necessarily true
5/6/22, 18:23 - bad: it kinda is
5/6/22, 18:23 - bad: it can always be better
5/6/22, 18:23 - Ethan: Maybe the ability to accomplish a task can be perfect
5/6/22, 18:23 - bad: in nature
5/6/22, 18:23 - bad: there are always flaws
5/6/22, 18:23 - Ethan: "can you throw this there?"
5/6/22, 18:23 - Ethan: Ig you do it it's perfect
5/6/22, 18:23 - Ethan: You literally cannot improve the result anymore
5/6/22, 18:23 - Ethan: So yea
5/6/22, 18:24 - bad: and theres no way of proving it
5/6/22, 18:24 - Ethan: Well not in math
5/6/22, 18:24 - Ethan: Exactly
5/6/22, 18:24 - bad: ya so the questoon doesnt make sense
5/6/22, 18:24 - Ethan: So the ideal state is sort of like binary
5/6/22, 18:24 - Ethan: If you successfully accomplish a task, it's the perfect result for the problem
5/6/22, 18:25 - Ethan: How bre
5/6/22, 18:26 - bad: one can never be perfect
5/6/22, 18:26 - bad: as humans
5/6/22, 18:26 - bad: since u litrtwlly excluded machines
5/6/22, 18:26 - Ethan: Yes but one can perfectly accomplish a task
5/6/22, 18:27 - bad: no
5/6/22, 18:27 - bad: it can always be done in a better way
5/6/22, 18:27 - Ethan: Yes but that's not qhat the task requires
5/6/22, 18:27 - Ethan: It doesn't sag throw this jn a certain way
5/6/22, 18:27 - Ethan: It just requires you to make the shot
5/6/22, 18:27 - bad: well playing in a sport
5/6/22, 18:27 - bad: if i can plau
5/6/22, 18:27 - bad: im perfect
5/6/22, 18:27 - bad: that doesnt make sense
5/6/22, 18:28 - bad: thats COMPLETING the TASK
5/6/22, 18:28 - bad: INPERFECTLY
5/6/22, 18:28 - bad: completion and perfection are different
5/6/22, 18:28 - Ethan: How are yoy supposed to perfect "throwing this ball in the hoop"
5/6/22, 18:28 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:28 - Ethan: Logic
5/6/22, 18:28 - bad: throw it with less energy
5/6/22, 18:28 - bad: throw it fadter
5/6/22, 18:29 - Ethan: You se that's a very subjective point of view
5/6/22, 18:29 - Ethan: Why is less energy beyyer
5/6/22, 18:29 - Ethan: Why js faster better
5/6/22, 18:29 - Ethan: Can you explain?
5/6/22, 18:29 - bad: because it usually is unless specified otherwisr
5/6/22, 18:29 - bad: why would u want to waste enegy
5/6/22, 18:29 - bad: unless specified
5/6/22, 18:29 - Ethan: "Usually is"
5/6/22, 18:29 - bad: its common sense
5/6/22, 18:30 - Ethan: Just because some is "usually done" jt doesn't mean it will always happen bre
5/6/22, 18:30 - bad: ya so
5/6/22, 18:30 - bad: unless specified otherwise
5/6/22, 18:30 - Ethan: Why do you always take such a personal approach to such argumenta
5/6/22, 18:30 - Ethan: So subjective
5/6/22, 18:30 - Ethan: Dude
5/6/22, 18:30 - Ethan: Dude
5/6/22, 18:30 - bad: because
5/6/22, 18:30 - Ethan: Dude
5/6/22, 18:30 - bad: the very definitoon
5/6/22, 18:30 - bad: of perfect
5/6/22, 18:30 - bad: IS subjective
5/6/22, 18:30 - Ethan: Is not "least energy"
5/6/22, 18:30 - Ethan: How
5/6/22, 18:31 - Ethan: HOW
5/6/22, 18:31 - bad: IT IS
5/6/22, 18:31 - Ethan: WHAT IS THAT LOGIC
5/6/22, 18:31 - Ethan: As i mentioned
5/6/22, 18:31 - bad: ok wait we re going off topic
5/6/22, 18:31 - Ethan: You can perfectly accomplish a task during either it's binary nature
5/6/22, 18:31 - bad: anyways as i was saying
5/6/22, 18:31 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:31 - Ethan: You literally don't male sense
5/6/22, 18:31 - bad: u cant change nothing and be perfect
5/6/22, 18:31 - Ethan: But you are changing something
5/6/22, 18:31 - Ethan: Your familiarity
5/6/22, 18:31 - bad: EXACTLY
5/6/22, 18:32 - bad: so its not REPEATEDLY
5/6/22, 18:32 - Ethan: Your experience
5/6/22, 18:32 - Ethan: It physically is
5/6/22, 18:32 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:32 - bad: its not the SAME thing
5/6/22, 18:32 - bad: like
5/6/22, 18:32 - bad: the factor of familiarity
5/6/22, 18:32 - bad: changrd
5/6/22, 18:32 - Ethan: Yes so you're not consciously changing anything
5/6/22, 18:32 - bad: ok im just going to state that same is ==
5/6/22, 18:32 - bad: u kinda are
5/6/22, 18:32 - bad: u learn from mistakes
5/6/22, 18:32 - bad: while practicing
5/6/22, 18:33 - Ethan: Bre it's your ideal end result but not your immediate goal
5/6/22, 18:33 - bad: what
5/6/22, 18:33 - Ethan: Your immediate goal is to repeatedly engage in the activity
5/6/22, 18:33 - bad: no
5/6/22, 18:33 - Ethan: In hopes of perfecting it
5/6/22, 18:33 - bad: ur immediately goal is to be better
5/6/22, 18:33 - bad: closer to perfevt
5/6/22, 18:33 - bad: and u do so
5/6/22, 18:33 - Ethan: Bre what
5/6/22, 18:34 - bad: BY engaging in the avtivity
5/6/22, 18:34 - Ethan: You have to go through a process to get better
5/6/22, 18:34 - bad: ya
5/6/22, 18:34 - bad: this
5/6/22, 18:34 - Ethan: So you are trying to go through the process
5/6/22, 18:34 - bad: this is rhe process
5/6/22, 18:34 - Ethan: That's your main goal
5/6/22, 18:34 - Ethan: Not yo "become" better
5/6/22, 18:34 - bad: because U WANT to be better
5/6/22, 18:34 - bad: dude
5/6/22, 18:34 - Ethan: Immediately
5/6/22, 18:34 - bad: U WANTING TO BE BETTER causes
5/6/22, 18:34 - bad: u to practice
5/6/22, 18:35 - bad: it starts from u wanting to be better
5/6/22, 18:35 - Ethan: Yes but it's not what you're trying to currently do, you're instead trying to go through the process
5/6/22, 18:35 - Ethan: Yed it stems from that
5/6/22, 18:35 - bad: the current action is NOT the immedite goal
5/6/22, 18:35 - Ethan: Doesn't mean you constantly think about it
5/6/22, 18:35 - Ethan: It kind of is
5/6/22, 18:35 - bad: ur goal is what u want to accomplish from doing something
5/6/22, 18:35 - bad: in this case its practing
5/6/22, 18:35 - Ethan: Your goal is to correctly go through the current process
5/6/22, 18:35 - bad: no
5/6/22, 18:35 - Ethan: Immediate goal
5/6/22, 18:35 - bad: dude
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: What
5/6/22, 18:36 - bad: the goal
5/6/22, 18:36 - bad: ur target
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: Immediae
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: Immediate
5/6/22, 18:36 - bad: u want to be better
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: Immediate
5/6/22, 18:36 - bad: no
5/6/22, 18:36 - bad: thats not even a goal
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: .
5/6/22, 18:36 - bad: practcting
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: ??
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: ??
5/6/22, 18:36 - bad: .
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: How
5/6/22, 18:36 - bad: its a process
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: Do you know what a goal is
5/6/22, 18:36 - bad: to ACCOMPLISH a goal
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: Your goal is to perfect the process
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 18:36 - bad: exactly
5/6/22, 18:36 - Ethan: .
5/6/22, 18:37 - bad: and practing is perfecting it
5/6/22, 18:37 - bad: its not the goal
5/6/22, 18:37 - Ethan: .
5/6/22, 18:37 - bad: yes
5/6/22, 18:37 - bad: dude
5/6/22, 18:37 - Ethan: Yes so you should know that it is in fact a goal
5/6/22, 18:37 - bad: no its not
5/6/22, 18:37 - bad: well goal ids very subjevtive as well
5/6/22, 18:37 - bad: sigh
5/6/22, 18:39 - Ethan: It's just something you want to accomplish via your actions
5/6/22, 18:39 - Ethan: So very broad definition
5/6/22, 18:59 - bad: VIA YOUR ACTIOMS
5/6/22, 18:59 - bad: BROOOOO
5/6/22, 19:00 - Ethan: ?
5/6/22, 19:00 - Ethan: Ypu hope that by repeatedly mimicking the ideal state you become more familiar
5/6/22, 19:00 - Ethan: Bre
5/6/22, 20:51 - bad: what u learning now
5/6/22, 20:53 - Ethan: Uh do you mean ongoing projects
5/6/22, 20:53 - bad: maybe
5/6/22, 20:53 - Ethan: Or like literally currently
5/6/22, 20:53 - bad: yes
5/6/22, 20:53 - bad: now
5/6/22, 20:54 - Ethan: I'm watching a YouTube video that my brother chose with some guy singing while playing fornite
5/6/22, 20:54 - Ethan: I'm just as confused as you
5/6/22, 20:54 - bad: breh
5/6/22, 20:54 - bad: what
5/6/22, 20:55 - bad: why so strange
5/6/22, 20:56 - Ethan: Idk
5/6/22, 20:56 - bad: breh
5/6/22, 20:56 - bad: so
5/6/22, 20:56 - Ethan: Idk rocket science
5/6/22, 20:56 - Ethan: A bit of typology
5/6/22, 20:57 - Ethan: I kinda want i get kerbal space station but it's like 1o bucks
5/6/22, 20:57 - bad: rvehheh
5/6/22, 20:57 - bad: what
5/6/22, 20:58 - bad: play spaceflight simulator with cheng
5/6/22, 20:58 - bad: hes literally addicted to it
5/6/22, 20:58 - Ethan: Oh I will try soon
5/6/22, 20:58 - bad: but its kinda basic
5/6/22, 20:58 - bad: not much science
5/6/22, 20:58 - Ethan: Ye exactly mostly game mechanics
5/6/22, 20:58 - Ethan: Ksp is begger
5/6/22, 20:58 - Ethan: Better
5/6/22, 20:58 - bad: only thing that might apply is building ur rocket
5/6/22, 20:59 - bad: isnt it kinda the same
5/6/22, 21:02 - Ethan: Uh it's more realistic
5/6/22, 21:03 - Ethan: Also more intricate
5/6/22, 21:03 - bad: hm
5/6/22, 21:03 - bad: well because its a pc game
5/6/22, 21:03 - bad: do ai stufffff
5/6/22, 21:03 - Ethan: Uh
5/6/22, 21:03 - bad: its fun
5/6/22, 21:03 - Ethan: Huh isn't it quite hard
5/6/22, 21:03 - Ethan: Like actual ai
5/6/22, 21:04 - bad: ok the thing is
5/6/22, 21:04 - bad: u just have to underdtand the concepts
5/6/22, 21:04 - Ethan: Uh i roughly do
5/6/22, 21:04 - bad: u dont exacrly need to know all the math behind it
5/6/22, 21:04 - Ethan: You see that's what always happens
5/6/22, 21:04 - Ethan: I understand the concept but don't know how to apply it
5/6/22, 21:04 - bad: then u can create ai models
5/6/22, 21:04 - bad: because libraries habdles everything
5/6/22, 21:04 - Ethan: So i just absorb knowledge
5/6/22, 21:05 - Ethan: Hmm
5/6/22, 21:05 - Ethan: Interesting
5/6/22, 21:05 - bad: er
5/6/22, 21:05 - bad: what concepts do u know
5/6/22, 21:05 - bad: come disc
5/6/22, 21:05 - bad: typing on pc is easier
5/6/22, 22:30 - Ethan: <Media omitted>
5/6/22, 22:30 - bad: dude
5/6/22, 22:33 - bad: woi
5/6/22, 22:33 - bad: only vote w
5/6/22, 22:33 - bad: 2
5/6/22, 22:43 - Ethan: <Media omitted>
5/6/22, 22:43 - Ethan: This js very interesting
5/7/22, 09:25 - Ethan: <Media omitted>
5/7/22, 09:49 - bad: breh what
5/7/22, 09:49 - bad: java is nice
5/7/22, 12:28 - bad: <Media omitted>
5/12/22, 15:26 - Ethan: Do you believe that you are what you do
5/12/22, 15:26 - Ethan: That you are defined by your achievements
5/12/22, 15:27 - Ethan: Do you fabricate an image in social settings, so much so that you begin to believe that your are the character you are playing
5/12/22, 15:34 - Ethan: Answer

5/19/22, 20:30 - Ethan: Like a different perspective towards ut
5/19/22, 20:30 - Ethan: Some kind of attached reward or outcome
5/19/22, 20:30 - Ethan: Why do you like it
5/19/22, 20:30 - Ethan: Can you at least explain
5/19/22, 20:30 - bad: im not sure
5/19/22, 20:30 - Ethan: Okay I have a theory
5/19/22, 20:30 - bad: ok
5/19/22, 20:31 - Ethan: Your parents are genius scientists that have been assigned to run an experiment regarding the boosting of a child's intelligence, be it via some psychological subliminal clues or a tangible machinery of sorts
5/19/22, 20:31 - Ethan: In other words they brainwashed you
5/19/22, 20:31 - bad: uh
5/19/22, 20:32 - Ethan: Actually not intelligence but work attitude
5/19/22, 20:32 - bad: uh
5/19/22, 20:32 - bad: thats a very unlikely theory
5/19/22, 20:33 - Ethan: I recommend interrogation
5/19/22, 20:33 - bad: thats an aggresive approach
5/19/22, 20:34 - bad: well this is getting off topic from study sessions
5/19/22, 20:34 - bad: lol
5/19/22, 20:34 - Ethan: Make it inconspicuous

5/19/22, 20:36 - Ethan: Speedrhn ut
5/19/22, 20:36 - Ethan: Speed is key
5/19/22, 20:36 - Ethan: So yea

5/19/22, 20:36 - bad: lol

5/19/22, 20:36 - bad: accuracy first

5/19/22, 20:36 - Ethan: Uh ok

5/19/22, 20:38 - Ethan: I hate drawing it more
5/19/22, 20:38 - bad: whats wrong with graphs
5/19/22, 20:38 - Ethan: It's the bane of my existence, or at least my grades
5/19/22, 20:39 - bad: so ur bad at drawing graphs
5/19/22, 20:39 - Ethan: It's so technical and overly granular
5/19/22, 20:39 - Ethan: Very much so
5/19/22, 20:39 - bad: which part
5/19/22, 20:39 - Ethan: And it's honestly pointless

5/19/22, 20:40 - Ethan: Uh what like the points and shut
5/19/22, 20:40 - Ethan: And the axis; finding the smallest division
5/19/22, 20:40 - Ethan: WHY
5/19/22, 20:40 - bad: draw a bigger graph
5/19/22, 20:40 - bad: :D
5/19/22, 20:40 - Ethan: Then the divisions will be smaller
5/19/22, 20:40 - Ethan: More dp
5/19/22, 20:40 - Ethan: Sigh
5/19/22, 20:40 - Ethan: When can you do it
5/19/22, 20:40 - bad: oh physics graph

5/19/22, 20:48 - Ethan: In my opinion
5/19/22, 20:48 - Ethan: No it's more interesting

5/20/22, 14:27 - Ethan: Ya
5/20/22, 16:50 - Ethan: Just realised the chips you gave me are literally tomato flavoured  potatoes
5/20/22, 16:50 - Ethan: What sins have we commited
5/20/22, 16:50 - Ethan: This is so absurd that ut us bound to penetrate into our tangible reality and result in a rupture in the space time continuum
5/20/22, 16:53 - Ethan: The timeline will bend
5/20/22, 16:53 - Ethan: It will crash into space, resulting jn a disorienting clash of irrationality
5/20/22, 16:54 - Ethan: It wil spiral into complete entropy, whereby infinite timelines exist within a single point jn space tjme
5/20/22, 16:54 - Ethan: As for space, the laws of physics are simply disregarded
5/20/22, 16:55 - Ethan: With a snap, just like that, energy is created, energy is destroyed
5/20/22, 16:55 - Ethan: Superpositions pop into existence on the macroscopic scale
5/20/22, 16:55 - Ethan: Solar systems disintegrate into nothingness
5/20/22, 16:56 - Ethan: Galaxies are torn apart, shrunk, expanded blipped out of existence, all at the same time
5/20/22, 16:56 - Ethan: The universe collapses in on itself. In the blink of an eye, the universe was but a dream
5/20/22, 16:56 - Ethan: A dream that never was
5/20/22, 16:57 - Ethan: It never existed, because it could not. Infinite timelines warped its solidity, its existence become dilute
5/20/22, 16:58 - Ethan: Tomato flavoured potato yoy say
5/20/22, 16:58 - Ethan: BLASPHEMY
5/20/22, 16:58 - Ethan: This message was deleted

5/20/22, 21:50 - bad: but its knowledge
5/20/22, 21:50 - bad: its learning
5/20/22, 21:50 - Ethan: um
5/20/22, 21:51 - Ethan: id rather understand stuff
5/20/22, 21:51 - Ethan: than memorise
5/20/22, 21:51 - bad: dont u understand
5/20/22, 21:51 - bad: it
5/20/22, 21:51 - bad: while memorising
5/20/22, 21:51 - Ethan: ye but that's not my focus
5/20/22, 21:51 - bad: uh
5/20/22, 21:51 - bad: so ur focus is results
5/20/22, 21:51 - Ethan: no just memorsinng
5/20/22, 21:51 - Ethan: like that's the strat'
5/20/22, 21:51 - bad: uh
5/20/22, 21:52 - bad: well
5/20/22, 21:52 - bad: theres a easy way
5/20/22, 21:52 - bad: to memorise stuff easily
5/20/22, 21:52 - bad: just keep thinking about it
5/20/22, 21:52 - Ethan: memory palacec
5/20/22, 21:52 - bad: every day
5/20/22, 21:52 - Ethan: cool concept
5/20/22, 21:52 - bad: for like a min
5/20/22, 21:52 - bad: which is what i do
5/20/22, 21:52 - bad: to memorise code
5/20/22, 21:52 - bad: lol
5/20/22, 21:52 - Ethan: hm
5/20/22, 21:53 - bad: it can be applied to everything
5/20/22, 21:55 - bad: do that
5/20/22, 21:55 - bad: like
5/20/22, 21:55 - bad: think on the train
5/20/22, 21:55 - bad: or something
5/20/22, 21:55 - bad: idk
5/20/22, 21:55 - bad: it kinda works
5/20/22, 21:55 - Ethan: os muscle memory
5/20/22, 21:55 - bad: maybe
5/21/22, 09:49 - Ethan: Are you going to boarding school
5/21/22, 09:50 - bad: breh what

5/21/22, 15:43 - Ethan: how do you arrange them
5/21/22, 15:43 - Ethan: can we just put a point being experiences in school
5/21/22, 15:43 - bad: experience
5/21/22, 15:43 - bad: difficulties
5/21/22, 15:43 - bad: and then

5/21/22, 15:56 - bad: dont steal my theme :)
5/21/22, 15:57 - Ethan: wait you make applications
5/21/22, 15:58 - bad: what
5/21/22, 15:58 - bad: whats that
5/21/22, 15:58 - Ethan: youj mentioned
5/21/22, 15:58 - Ethan: coding applications
5/21/22, 15:58 - Ethan: jmmmmm
5/21/22, 15:58 - bad: breh
5/21/22, 15:58 - bad: its to make ti sound cool
5/21/22, 15:58 - bad: i half made a mobile app
5/21/22, 15:58 - bad: so yes
5/21/22, 15:58 - Ethan: what
5/21/22, 15:58 - Ethan: is it the tank thing
5/21/22, 15:58 - bad: kinda
5/21/22, 15:59 - bad: and pw
5/21/22, 15:59 - Ethan: if you were to live forever
5/21/22, 15:59 - Ethan: then wuldnt you not be motivated to learn
5/21/22, 15:59 - Ethan: uh
5/21/22, 15:59 - bad: what
5/21/22, 15:59 - Ethan: the quote
5/21/22, 15:59 - bad: because
5/21/22, 15:59 - bad: u will eventually use the knowledge
5/21/22, 15:59 - bad: u learnt
5/21/22, 16:00 - bad: it will stick with u
5/21/22, 16:00 - bad: forever
5/21/22, 16:00 - Ethan: .
5/21/22, 16:00 - bad: what
5/21/22, 16:00 - bad: what do u mean
5/21/22, 16:00 - bad: stop using double negative
5/21/22, 16:00 - Ethan: if you have forevrfe to learn shit
5/21/22, 16:00 - Ethan: then you wonthave the motivation to learn everyday''
5/21/22, 16:00 - bad: why
5/21/22, 16:00 - Ethan: because there's not point learning so much everyday
5/21/22, 16:00 - Ethan: you have infinnite days to learn
5/21/22, 16:01 - bad: dudeeee
5/21/22, 16:01 - bad: dont question ghandi
5/21/22, 16:01 - bad: :)

5/21/22, 16:01 - bad: yes
5/21/22, 16:02 - Ethan: very interesting slides
5/21/22, 16:02 - bad: hmm
5/21/22, 16:02 - bad: now u owe me a dollar
5/21/22, 16:02 - Ethan: why

5/21/22, 16:04 - bad: i wouldnt go to jail for that
5/21/22, 16:04 - Ethan: and assert dominance via number
5/21/22, 16:04 - bad: uh
5/21/22, 16:04 - Ethan: well you stole from ma classmate
5/21/22, 16:04 - Ethan: right

5/21/22, 16:04 - bad: its ok
5/21/22, 16:04 - bad: its fine
5/21/22, 16:04 - bad: no dp
5/21/22, 16:04 - Ethan: should i put table of contents
5/21/22, 16:04 - Ethan: no right
5/21/22, 16:04 - bad: no
5/21/22, 16:04 - bad: make it short
5/21/22, 16:05 - bad: and its over quickly
5/21/22, 16:05 - Ethan: but that means the qna increases
5/21/22, 16:05 - bad: no
5/21/22, 16:05 - bad: once they run out of stuff
5/21/22, 16:05 - bad: u can leave
5/21/22, 16:05 - Ethan: what if they dont
5/21/22, 16:05 - Ethan: theyll asl random unrelated shit
5/21/22, 16:05 - Ethan: to fill up the time
5/21/22, 16:05 - bad: like what
5/21/22, 16:05 - bad: they dont know any other stuff
5/21/22, 16:05 - bad: they cant stuff that are unrealted to u
5/21/22, 16:06 - bad: ask
5/21/22, 16:06 - bad: just predict what they gonna ask
5/21/22, 16:06 - bad: and throw them in the slides
5/21/22, 16:49 - Ethan: would you rather absorb knowledge or learn how to solve problems
5/21/22, 16:49 - bad: what
5/21/22, 16:50 - bad: canr u solve problems witb knowledge
5/21/22, 16:50 - Ethan: no i mean make calculations
5/21/22, 16:50 - bad: what
5/21/22, 16:50 - bad: math
5/21/22, 16:50 - Ethan: knowledge meaning just raw information
5/21/22, 16:50 - Ethan: sort of like history vs physics
5/21/22, 16:50 - Ethan: do you understand
5/21/22, 16:50 - bad: breh
5/21/22, 16:50 - bad: how
5/21/22, 16:50 - bad: knowdlege is processed
5/21/22, 16:50 - Ethan: so what
5/21/22, 16:51 - Ethan: so which one
5/21/22, 16:51 - bad: why knowledge cannot be physics
5/21/22, 16:51 - bad: thats knowledge too
5/21/22, 16:51 - Ethan: fine formula vs data
5/21/22, 16:51 - bad: well anyways history sucks
5/21/22, 16:51 - Ethan: data can be events, facts, etc
5/21/22, 16:51 - bad: breh
5/21/22, 16:51 - Ethan: dude it's just an example
5/21/22, 16:51 - Ethan: formulae
5/21/22, 16:51 - Ethan: vs data
5/21/22, 16:51 - Ethan: .
5/21/22, 16:51 - bad: but u need data
5/21/22, 16:52 - bad: for formula
5/21/22, 16:52 - Ethan: uh i guess you can memorise the formulae
5/21/22, 16:52 - Ethan: but it doesnt let you understand the world better
5/21/22, 16:52 - Ethan: it's very specific
5/21/22, 16:52 - bad: data is lower level than formula
5/21/22, 16:52 - Ethan: compared to knowledge
5/21/22, 16:52 - bad: isnr knowledge
5/21/22, 16:52 - Ethan: ok let me phrase it this way
5/21/22, 16:52 - bad: knowing stuff
5/21/22, 16:52 - bad: lol
5/21/22, 16:52 - Ethan: would you rather
5/21/22, 16:53 - Ethan: learn about the various planets and phenomena occurring in space or how to calculate a planet's orbit
5/21/22, 16:53 - bad: both
5/21/22, 16:53 - bad: :)
5/21/22, 16:53 - Ethan: bro
5/21/22, 16:53 - Ethan: rather
5/21/22, 16:53 - bad: why cant i learn both
5/21/22, 16:53 - bad: just google
5/21/22, 16:53 - Ethan: which one more
5/21/22, 16:54 - bad: the first one
5/21/22, 16:54 - bad: is the foundation
5/21/22, 16:54 - Ethan: i see
5/21/22, 16:54 - bad: sort of
5/21/22, 16:54 - bad: for the second one
5/21/22, 16:54 - Ethan: uh
5/21/22, 16:55 - Ethan: not necessarily
5/21/22, 16:55 - Ethan: ok so understanding why a ball moves a certain way vs calculating its trajectory
5/21/22, 16:55 - Ethan: pick one
5/21/22, 16:56 - bad: breh same thing
5/21/22, 16:56 - Ethan: no?
5/21/22, 16:56 - bad: what
5/21/22, 16:56 - bad: the first one is still the foundation
5/21/22, 16:56 - bad: its concept
5/21/22, 16:56 - bad: u have to know concept
5/21/22, 16:56 - Ethan: exactly
5/21/22, 16:56 - bad: before doing math
5/21/22, 16:56 - Ethan: schols skim through the concept bit
5/21/22, 16:56 - Ethan: practicality over conceptualisation
5/21/22, 16:56 - Ethan: so pick one
5/21/22, 16:56 - bad: breh
5/21/22, 16:57 - Ethan: what
5/21/22, 16:57 - bad: dont u need to know concepts
5/21/22, 16:57 - bad: before applying
5/21/22, 16:57 - Ethan: you actually dont
5/21/22, 16:57 - bad: uh
5/21/22, 16:57 - bad: what
5/21/22, 16:57 - Ethan: we basically memorise formulae
5/21/22, 16:57 - Ethan: for example
5/21/22, 16:57 - bad: thats dum
5/21/22, 16:57 - Ethan: weprobably dont understand why formuale are a thing
5/21/22, 16:57 - Ethan: like log
5/21/22, 16:57 - Ethan: or polynomial
5/21/22, 16:57 - Ethan: think about igt
5/21/22, 16:57 - Ethan: we are just given the formulae
5/21/22, 16:58 - bad: yes
5/21/22, 16:58 - Ethan: same for physics
5/21/22, 16:58 - bad: school is bad
5/21/22, 16:58 - bad: so
5/21/22, 16:58 - bad: u have to read it up urself
5/21/22, 16:58 - Ethan: so which one
5/21/22, 16:58 - Ethan: would you prefer to be taught
5/21/22, 16:58 - bad: concepts
5/21/22, 16:58 - bad: they have to teach both
5/21/22, 16:59 - Ethan: they do
5/21/22, 16:59 - Ethan: it's a matter of priority
5/21/22, 16:59 - bad: well they do start with the concept first
5/21/22, 16:59 - bad: just not very deeply
5/21/22, 16:59 - Ethan: exactly
5/21/22, 16:59 - Ethan: bre it's not about which one starts first
5/21/22, 16:59 - bad: u just said priority
5/21/22, 16:59 - bad: breh
5/21/22, 16:59 - Ethan: ya
5/21/22, 16:59 - Ethan: it's a bout time spent
5/21/22, 16:59 - Ethan: why would the orientation matter
5/21/22, 17:00 - Ethan: bre
5/21/22, 17:00 - bad: it does
5/21/22, 17:00 - bad: u need to kow concepts
5/21/22, 17:00 - bad: first
5/21/22, 17:00 - Ethan: exactly so this is not related to priority
5/21/22, 17:00 - Ethan: it's not ebcause they prioritise it
5/21/22, 17:00 - Ethan: it i just logical
5/21/22, 17:00 - bad: yes
5/21/22, 17:00 - bad: what are u tryna do here
5/21/22, 17:00 - bad: with this concept thing
5/21/22, 17:00 - Ethan: what
5/21/22, 17:01 - bad: why did u ask the questio
5/21/22, 17:01 - Ethan: because i just realised someting
5/21/22, 17:01 - Ethan: the things i like to learn about are concepts and facts
5/21/22, 17:01 - Ethan: the things i hate are the formulae and what not
5/21/22, 17:01 - Ethan: this is hence very interesting
5/21/22, 17:01 - bad: but u need formulae to apply the concepts
5/21/22, 17:01 - bad: if not learn for what
5/21/22, 17:01 - Ethan: it's a matter of the field'
5/21/22, 17:02 - bad: u just know it but u dont use it
5/21/22, 17:02 - Ethan: some fields require you to have practicality
5/21/22, 17:02 - Ethan: some just rewquire knowledghe
5/21/22, 17:02 - Ethan: bre
5/21/22, 17:02 - bad: like
5/21/22, 17:02 - bad: what
5/21/22, 17:02 - Ethan: understrand the world better
5/21/22, 17:02 - bad: what fields
5/21/22, 17:02 - bad: just require knowledge
5/21/22, 17:02 - bad: they are need u to apply
5/21/22, 17:02 - bad: to some extent
5/21/22, 17:02 - Ethan: i guess teachers
5/21/22, 17:02 - bad: uh
5/21/22, 17:02 - bad: thats it
5/21/22, 17:02 - Ethan: let me think
5/21/22, 17:03 - Ethan: people who study animals
5/21/22, 17:03 - Ethan: zoologists
5/21/22, 17:03 - bad: what
5/21/22, 17:03 - Ethan: there are actually a lot
5/21/22, 17:03 - bad: they need
5/21/22, 17:03 - bad: to handle animals
5/21/22, 17:04 - Ethan: basically a job where you study tings
5/21/22, 17:04 - Ethan: dude
5/21/22, 17:04 - Ethan: you study them
5/21/22, 17:04 - bad: breh
5/21/22, 17:04 - bad: student
5/21/22, 17:04 - Ethan: you dont interact with them
5/21/22, 17:04 - Ethan: that's not a job
5/21/22, 17:04 - bad: lol
5/21/22, 17:04 - bad: its a occupationn
5/21/22, 17:04 - Ethan: ya so there's a lot
5/21/22, 17:04 - bad: thats dum
5/21/22, 17:04 - bad: they have to apply it
5/21/22, 17:04 - bad: like cmon
5/21/22, 17:04 - Ethan: what
5/21/22, 17:04 - bad: if not theyre just a computer
5/21/22, 17:04 - Ethan: uh what
5/21/22, 17:04 - bad: which stores information
5/21/22, 17:05 - Ethan: so what
5/21/22, 17:05 - Ethan: spread the knowledge
5/21/22, 17:05 - Ethan: bre
5/21/22, 17:05 - bad: and outputs stuff
5/21/22, 17:05 - bad: when u want them
5/21/22, 17:05 - bad: yes
5/21/22, 17:05 - Ethan: it's not bad
5/21/22, 17:05 - bad: basically computer
5/21/22, 17:05 - bad: theyre useless
5/21/22, 17:05 - Ethan: just absorb info
5/21/22, 17:05 - bad: a computer can do a better job
5/21/22, 17:05 - Ethan: no?
5/21/22, 17:05 - bad: but a computer may not know how to apply
5/21/22, 17:05 - bad: the data
5/21/22, 17:05 - Ethan: they literally have to discover things
5/21/22, 17:05 - Ethan: and study it
5/21/22, 17:05 - Ethan: bro what
5/21/22, 17:05 - bad: what
5/21/22, 17:05 - bad: they cant understand
5/21/22, 17:06 - bad: they can only store
5/21/22, 17:06 - Ethan: they can
5/21/22, 17:06 - bad: except for ai
5/21/22, 17:06 - Ethan: just programme it
5/21/22, 17:06 - Ethan: that's the point of a computer
5/21/22, 17:06 - Ethan: uh
5/21/22, 17:06 - bad: thats
5/21/22, 17:06 - bad: humans
5/21/22, 17:06 - Ethan: it's goal is not to absorb information only
5/21/22, 17:06 - bad: programming it
5/21/22, 17:06 - Ethan: it's to accmplish tasks'
5/21/22, 17:06 - bad: thats
5/21/22, 17:06 - bad: applying
5/21/22, 17:06 - Ethan: well we have to input data right
5/21/22, 17:06 - Ethan: ya so your analogy is flawed
5/21/22, 17:07 - bad: so is ur examples
5/21/22, 17:07 - bad: the jobs
5/21/22, 17:07 - bad: they must apply some skills
5/21/22, 17:07 - Ethan: obviously
5/21/22, 17:07 - bad: ya
5/21/22, 17:07 - bad: so
5/21/22, 17:07 - bad: need apply
5/21/22, 17:07 - Ethan: but not memorise something for the sake of it
5/21/22, 17:07 - bad: ofc
5/21/22, 17:07 - Ethan: like the goal is not to apply
5/21/22, 17:07 - Ethan: but to understand
5/21/22, 17:07 - Ethan: get it now
5/21/22, 17:07 - Ethan: >
5/21/22, 17:07 - Ethan: ?
5/21/22, 17:07 - bad: but when u understand it
5/21/22, 17:07 - bad: u will apply
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: i mean
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: u will find a way
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: to apply
5/21/22, 17:08 - Ethan: um
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: or
5/21/22, 17:08 - Ethan: define apply
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: u will apply when u need it
5/21/22, 17:08 - Ethan: define apply
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: use ur knowledge
5/21/22, 17:08 - Ethan: do you mean spread the information
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: to accomplish task
5/21/22, 17:08 - Ethan: and make money
5/21/22, 17:08 - Ethan: or actually help humanity
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: what
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: uh
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: .
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: .
5/21/22, 17:08 - Ethan: bre define tasks
5/21/22, 17:08 - Ethan: what tasks
5/21/22, 17:08 - bad: idk
5/21/22, 17:08 - Ethan: .
5/21/22, 17:09 - Ethan: essentially their purpose is to learn
5/21/22, 17:09 - Ethan: not to apply
5/21/22, 17:09 - Ethan: it's like a theoretical physicist vs a factory worker
5/21/22, 17:09 - Ethan: one keeps learning while the other keeps using what he has already learnt
5/21/22, 17:10 - bad: well i mean
5/21/22, 17:10 - bad: to keep learning
5/21/22, 17:10 - bad: u have to use knowledge
5/21/22, 17:10 - bad: u learnt before
5/21/22, 17:10 - Ethan: not necessarily
5/21/22, 17:10 - bad: yes u do
5/21/22, 17:10 - Ethan: learn via observations
5/21/22, 17:10 - Ethan: bre
5/21/22, 17:10 - bad: more complicated stuff
5/21/22, 17:10 - Ethan: uh
5/21/22, 17:10 - bad: and u need to understand ur observations
5/21/22, 17:10 - bad: u can see it
5/21/22, 17:10 - Ethan: so you mean accelerated learning
5/21/22, 17:10 - bad: but u need to know whats happening
5/21/22, 17:11 - bad: and u use previous stuff u leant
5/21/22, 17:11 - Ethan: bre exactly from your own knowledge
5/21/22, 17:11 - bad: yes
5/21/22, 17:11 - bad: thats applying
5/21/22, 17:11 - Ethan: you donty accomplish tasks
5/21/22, 17:11 - bad: its a task
5/21/22, 17:11 - Ethan: you simply learn
5/21/22, 17:11 - Ethan: um
5/21/22, 17:11 - bad: learning is a task
5/21/22, 17:11 - bad: :D
5/21/22, 17:11 - Ethan: bre
5/21/22, 17:11 - Ethan: comapre it to working in a factory
5/21/22, 17:11 - Ethan: your goal
5/21/22, 17:11 - Ethan: is to apply skills
5/21/22, 17:11 - Ethan: while the former is to learn
5/21/22, 17:12 - Ethan: it's about the process and driving motivation
5/21/22, 17:12 - Ethan: obviously application will be required
5/21/22, 17:12 - Ethan: but that's not the point
5/21/22, 17:12 - bad: why
5/21/22, 17:12 - bad: its applying
5/21/22, 17:12 - bad: anyways
5/21/22, 17:12 - bad: ima go swim now
5/21/22, 17:13 - bad: lol
5/21/22, 17:13 - bad: :)

5/21/22, 17:13 - Ethan: dude the purpose is to lear
5/21/22, 17:13 - Ethan: you inevitably have to apply shit
5/21/22, 17:13 - bad: thats a task
5/21/22, 17:13 - Ethan: but your job is to learn
5/21/22, 17:13 - bad: YES
5/21/22, 17:13 - bad: thats what i mean
5/21/22, 17:13 - Ethan: that's irrelevant tho

5/22/22, 10:16 - Ethan: I thought you meant since uou are paying for school you get the services
5/22/22, 10:16 - Ethan: Which doesn't make sense
5/22/22, 10:16 - Ethan: Not exactly
5/22/22, 10:17 - bad: then
